# V4 Ontologies — Illustrative Example

This file continues [README.md](README.md), which describes the Category, Cell, Graph, Persona, and Organization ontologies, and is continued by [app-behavior.md](app-behavior.md), which documents how the app behaves on top of this data. It provides an illustrative example — a hypothetical user, Alice Walker — showing how those ontologies are used together, followed by diagram-generation instructions and the full validation pipeline for the example dataset.

## Illustrative Example: Alice

This section describes the local dataset for a hypothetical user, Alice Walker. Alice's cells live in a tree of cells rooted at `example/Cells/`, where this repo carries each one as a folder — marked as a cell by the `_cell-attachments` folder inside it, and holding a cell DataBook file — all of which is [development scaffolding](cell-databook.md#development-scaffolding) rather than anything a running v4 produces (see [storage.md](storage.md)). Every mention of "Self" in the following is a reference to the user, Alice.

### Bob and Fred

Alice knows two people, Bob and Fred. Under *Others* she has created a two-member cell for each, sharing one with Bob and the other with Fred.

In her shared cell with Bob ([cell 16](<example/Cells/People/Others/Bob Johnson/Bob Johnson(others).databook.md>)) Alice has included some claims about herself ([graph 12](<example/Cells/People/Others/Bob Johnson/Bob Johnson(others).databook.md#graph-12>)) including her given name "Alice", her family name "Walker", etc. She has included ([graph 4](<example/Cells/People/Others/Bob Johnson/Bob Johnson(others).databook.md#graph-04>)) her claim that Bob's favorite drink is an oat milk cappuccino. Bob has claimed some contact information about himself ([graph 2](<example/Cells/People/Others/Bob Johnson/Bob Johnson(others).databook.md#graph-02>)), and he claims that her favorite drink is Pepsi ([graph 8](<example/Cells/People/Others/Bob Johnson/Bob Johnson(others).databook.md#graph-08>)).

### Taking Care of Sophia

To capture Alice's family-related relationship with her daughter, Sophia Walker, Alice created a cell ([cell 12](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Sophia Walker(immediate-family).databook.md>)) named *Sophia Walker*, nested under her *Immediate Family* cell. Its two members are Alice herself ([graph 21](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Sophia Walker(immediate-family).databook.md#graph-21>)) and her husband Dave ([graph 5](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Sophia Walker(immediate-family).databook.md#graph-05>)). Sophia has no instance of the app, so she cannot join the cell as a member: Alice selected the cell and tapped **Add Topic**, and from the modal dialog that asks which template the new topic should follow she kept the default, *Contact Info* (`pshapes:ContactInfoShape`) — the dialog offers many other choices alongside it, from *Debit Card* to *Passport* to *Trip Itinerary* (see app-behavior.md's [Adding a Tool](app-behavior.md#adding-a-tool)). That added a graph about her by hand, held by a form tool on the cell ([graph 7](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Sophia Walker(immediate-family).databook.md#graph-07>)). That manual step is what gives an ordinary `cat:ImmediateFamily` cell — a category whose template cell declares no tool, and so offers no shape hint either — a form tool all the same, with Sophia as its derived subject (see integrity.md's Check 18).

Alice spends time taking care of her daughter, so she has assembled some information about Sophia herself, in cells she has not shared. In the *Health & Wellness* cell ([cell 13](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Health & Wellness/Health & Wellness.databook.md>)) Alice keeps a record of Sophia's physical characteristics such as height, eye color, and hair color in [graph 17](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Health & Wellness/Health & Wellness.databook.md#graph-17>). This is a single-member cell whose subject is Sophia. Its required `member` slot holds a minimal graph about Alice herself ([graph 35](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Health & Wellness/Health & Wellness.databook.md#graph-35>)). [Graph 17](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Health & Wellness/Health & Wellness.databook.md#graph-17>) is held by the cell's form tool.

Under *Medical* > *Provider* > *Primary Care Physician*, Alice keeps a record of Dr. Jane Starostina, Sophia's primary care physician ([graph 25](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Health & Wellness/Medical/Provider/Jane Starostina/Jane Starostina(primary-care-physician).databook.md#graph-25>)). This is a single-member cell whose subject is Jane.

Alice's husband Dave is involved in taking care of their daughter. The two parents need to arrange medical appointments, etc. To do so, they need to share and synchronize medical information about Sophia, including her list of medications, medical history, health insurance policy, contact information and so on. To work on this as a team, Alice creates a two-member *Medical Appointment* cell and shares it with Dave. They both use it to share information about Sophia's upcoming medical appointment ([graph 26](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Health & Wellness/Medical/Provider/Medical Appointment/Medical Appointment.databook.md#graph-26>)). This graph includes the name of Sophia's doctor (primary care physician) which the app copies from the Dr. Jane Starostina cell ([graph 25](<example/Cells/People/Immediate Family/Sophia Walker/Health & Wellness/Medical/Provider/Jane Starostina/Jane Starostina(primary-care-physician).databook.md#graph-25>)).

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/people2.png" alt="People cells, continued — Immediate Family, Sophia Walker, and her Health & Wellness, Medical, and Provider cells"></p>

### Working for Acme

Alice is an employee of Acme, so under her *Work* cell she has created an *Acme* cell to represent her employer. Since Acme is an organization, rather than using `cat:Person` categories she has switched to `cat:Organization` categories (light blue color).

Under *Employees* she has added her own *Alice Walker* cell holding her Contact Info claims ([graph 10](<example/Cells/Work/Acme/Employees/Alice Walker/Alice Walker(employees).databook.md#graph-10>)) — job title at Acme, work telephone number, work email, etc. One of the employees she works with is Paula Walker, so she has a *Paula Walker* cell for her — a two-member cell with Paula herself as the second member ([graph 6](<example/Cells/Work/Acme/Employees/Paula Walker/Paula Walker(employees).databook.md#graph-06>), a bare identifying claim mirroring Alice's own) alongside Alice's own claims about herself ([graph 20](<example/Cells/Work/Acme/Employees/Paula Walker/Paula Walker(employees).databook.md#graph-20>)) — neither of which has been shared with Paula, since Alice has not yet shared the cell with her: both graphs are still her own claims, graph 6 included.

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/work.png" alt="Work cells"></p>

### Service Providers

Alice has relationships with two companies, Google and AT&T (her cell phone provider). Both are `cat:Companies` cells carrying a form tool: each `c:member` entry is the usual bare contact-info stub, and each tool graph carries that company's service account itself — service name, username, service URI, and password — typed `sa:ServiceAccount`. Google's username is her Gmail address; AT&T's is her mobile phone number, since AT&T accounts are logged into by phone number rather than a separate handle.

Alice has a third such relationship, with Arca: she holds a **subscription to the Arca cell backup service**. Its cell (cell 50) sits alongside *Google* and *ATT* under *Companies*, and from the outside it looks like them — a `cat:Companies` cell whose form tool's graph carries the account she holds with the provider ([graph 97](<example/Cells/Companies/Arca/Arca(companies).databook.md#graph-97>)), typed `sa:ServiceAccount`.

What the subscription actually buys her, though, is *membership*. By inviting Arca's service into this cell as a `c:member`, Alice ensures the cell's entire contents are backed up — its note, its attachments, her own private files in it, and the graph claims behind its `c:member` entries and its tools. The private files are covered because Arca's service acts for Alice herself, and a service's access is its principal's access; a service acting for some other member would not see them. And the arrangement is not specific to this one cell: the same invitation works anywhere, so every other cell Alice invites Arca into as a member is backed up on exactly the same terms. Backup coverage is therefore per-cell and opt-in rather than account-wide — a cell is backed up precisely when Arca is one of its members, which is a fact each cell carries in its own `c:member` list rather than a setting held somewhere outside the tree. That is the practical reason a backup provider is modeled as a member at all instead of as an external service the app merely talks to: membership is what scopes it, and it travels with the cell.

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/companies.png" alt="Companies cells"></p>

### Backing Up Cells

What sets the *Arca* cell apart from *Google* and *ATT* structurally is its second `c:member` entry. `:Arca_Backup`, the `s:ArcaBackup` service Arca provides, joins the cell as a real member with its own self-claimed graph ([graph 96](<example/Cells/Companies/Arca/Arca(companies).databook.md#graph-96>)), carrying both `s:actsFor :Self` and `s:providedBy :Arca`. Two distinct members — Alice ([graph 95](<example/Cells/Companies/Arca/Arca(companies).databook.md#graph-95>)) and the backup service — make this a two-member cell, where the *Google* and *ATT* cells each have only Alice.

`s:ArcaBackup` sits under `s:AgentService`, so like every agent service it acts for exactly one member — Alice invited it, and it is her own copy of the cell it preserves. That is what separates it from the `s:ServiceProvider` in the *Citibank* and *Boston Hub Society* cells, which acts for the organization behind it instead: no organization claims on Arca Backup's behalf, `:Arca` is named only as its `s:providedBy` value, and the service claims its own member graph directly. Among the three agent-service leaves it is the only one naming a provider at all — `s:ChatGPT` in *Kyoto Trip 2027* carries no `s:providedBy`, because OpenAI is not a party to that cell's relationship, whereas Arca genuinely is a party to this one. Like every service, it can never be a `c:creator` or a `c:owner`: Alice alone created and owns this cell.

### Checking Account and Debit Card

Alice has a checking account (and associated debit card) at Citibank. In our example Citibank is compatible with PDN and participates directly, claiming this cell's own topic content — a debit card, a checking account, and Citibank's own record of Alice's online service account — in [graph 76](<example/Cells/Finances/Banking & Payments Firms/Citibank/Citibank(banking-payments).databook.md#graph-76>). It is colored green because the claimant is Citibank, not Alice. Citibank also claims its own member entry, [graph 27](<example/Cells/Finances/Banking & Payments Firms/Citibank/Citibank(banking-payments).databook.md#graph-27>) — the identity the bank presents as one of the cell's two members, carried by `:Citibank_Service`, the `s:ServiceProvider` it provides — and that graph is green for the same reason. Alice separately self-asserts her own username and password for that same online account in [graph 75](<example/Cells/Finances/Banking & Payments Firms/Citibank/Citibank(banking-payments).databook.md#graph-75>). Her own required given-name member entry is [graph 77](<example/Cells/Finances/Banking & Payments Firms/Citibank/Citibank(banking-payments).databook.md#graph-77>), which also carries her own notes about Citibank as an institution.

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/finances.png" alt="Financial cells"></p>

### Birth Certificate and Driver's License

Alice was born in Texas, and its vital records department issued her a birth certificate. Alice has manually entered the information from her birth certificate into the *Birth Certificate* cell's topic graph ([graph 78](<example/Cells/Government/State/Birth Certificate/Birth Certificate.databook.md#graph-78>)) and has included a scan of her paper birth certificate as content in that cell's Attachments area (not shown). She recently moved to Paradise, California, and was issued a license by the California DMV. Alice manually entered the information from her plastic license card into the *Drivers License* cell's topic graph ([graph 79](<example/Cells/Government/State/Drivers License/Drivers License.databook.md#graph-79>)) and included a scan of it as content in that cell's Attachments area (not shown). Each cell's required `member` entry ([graph 24](<example/Cells/Government/State/Birth Certificate/Birth Certificate.databook.md#graph-24>), [graph 15](<example/Cells/Government/State/Drivers License/Drivers License.databook.md#graph-15>)) is just her bare given name.

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/gov-state.png" alt="Government — State cells"></p>

### Passport and Social Security Number

Alice has a social security number (SSN) issued to her by the Social Security Administration, recorded in the *SSN* cell's topic graph ([graph 80](<example/Cells/Government/Federal/SSN/SSN.databook.md#graph-80>)). Similarly, she has a passport issued to her by the US Department of State, recorded in the *Passport* cell's topic graph ([graph 81](<example/Cells/Government/Federal/Passport/Passport.databook.md#graph-81>)). Each cell's required `member` entry ([graph 23](<example/Cells/Government/Federal/SSN/SSN.databook.md#graph-23>), [graph 19](<example/Cells/Government/Federal/Passport/Passport.databook.md#graph-19>)) is just her bare given name.

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/gov-federal.png" alt="Government — Federal cells"></p>

### Current and Previous Homes

Alice used to live in Boston until late 2025, but now lives in Paradise, CA. Both cells are `cat:Home` cells carrying a form tool: each `c:member` entry ([graph 13](<example/Cells/Home/Previous/Boston/Boston(home).databook.md#graph-13>), [graph 18](<example/Cells/Home/Paradise/Paradise(home).databook.md#graph-18>)) is the usual bare given-name stub, and each tool graph carries the actual `residences:Residence` — Boston's in [graph 82](<example/Cells/Home/Previous/Boston/Boston(home).databook.md#graph-82>), Paradise's in [graph 83](<example/Cells/Home/Paradise/Paradise(home).databook.md#graph-83>).

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/home.png" alt="Home cells"></p>

### Possessions (Things)

Alice, like everyone, owns (or borrows, or rents) zillions of things. A tiny few of them are described in [graph 22](<example/Cells/Things/Things.databook.md#graph-22>), which concentrates on identity documents: a plastic driver's license card, a health insurance card, and a social security number card. Alice also has a wallet, and keeps some of these cards in it and some separately. She has a vehicle too — see [Vehicles](#vehicles) below. Everything else she owns is out of scope for this example.

Here are a few lines from [graph 22](<example/Cells/Things/Things.databook.md#graph-22>):

```

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/things.png" alt="Things cells"></p>

#### Vehicles

Under her *Things* cell, Alice has created a *Vehicles* cell — a purely organizational category node, like *Pets* — and, nested inside it, a cell for her car, named *RAV4* after the car itself (reusing its parent's own `cat:Vehicles` category, the same "child folder reuses its parent's category" pattern the *Ginger* cell already uses under *Pets*). Thanks to `cat:Vehicles`'s own template cell, the *RAV4* cell identifies the car's vehicle type, make and model (real Wikidata individuals — Toyota and the Toyota RAV4), model year, VIN, color, body type, fuel type, drive wheel configuration, current odometer reading, and engine specification as a real `v:Vehicle` individual rather than a bare label ([graph 63](<example/Cells/Things/Vehicles/RAV4/RAV4(vehicles).databook.md#graph-63>)).

Here is a snippet from [graph 63](<example/Cells/Things/Vehicles/RAV4/RAV4(vehicles).databook.md#graph-63>):

```

### Caring for Ginger

Alice also has a cat, Ginger. Under her *Pets* cell she has created a *Ginger* cell ([cell 41](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Ginger(pets).databook.md>)) for this specific pet — reusing its parent's own `cat:Pets` category, and now, thanks to `cat:Pets`'s own template cell, identifying Ginger's name, species (*Felis catus*, an NCBITaxon class IRI), breed (VBO's own "Mixed Breed (Cat)" class), birth date, and current body weight as a real `pets:Pet` individual rather than a bare label ([graph 37](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Ginger(pets).databook.md#graph-37>)).

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/pets.png" alt="Pets cells"></p>

Under [cell 41](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Ginger(pets).databook.md>) is a *Medical* cell ([cell 40](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Medical/Medical.databook.md>)) that Alice created and shared with Paula, who also helps look after Ginger. Its topic is a record of Ginger's medical care (reusing its parent's own `cat:PetsMedical` category) — a completed course of amoxicillin/clavulanate (brand name Clavamox, from Zoetis) and an ongoing daily glucosamine/chondroitin joint supplement ([topic graph 32](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Medical/Medical.databook.md#graph-32>)). The cell contains Alice's claims as a cell `member` in [graph 33](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Medical/Medical.databook.md#graph-33>) and Paula's claims as a cell `member` in [graph 57](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Medical/Medical.databook.md#graph-57>).

Under [cell 41](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Ginger(pets).databook.md>) there is also a *Care & Feeding* cell ([cell 42](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Care & Feeding/Care & Feeding.databook.md>)) (`cat:PetsCareAndFeeding`) that Alice also created and also shared with Paula. Its topic records Alice's day-to-day care instructions for Ginger: her feeding schedule and where she sleeps ([topic graph 60](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Care & Feeding/Care & Feeding.databook.md#graph-60>)). The cell contains Alice's claims as a cell `member` in [graph 58](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Care & Feeding/Care & Feeding.databook.md#graph-58>) and Paula's claims as a cell `member` in [graph 59](<example/Cells/Pets/Ginger/Care & Feeding/Care & Feeding.databook.md#graph-59>).

When Alice shares her Medical cell with Paula, the app must decide where to file it in Paula's own tree — see app-behavior.md's [Auto-Filing on Receipt](app-behavior.md#auto-filing-on-receipt) for how that filing heuristic works, using this very cell as its worked example.

### Boston Hub Society

Alice is a member of the Boston Hub Society, an informal professional networking society. In our example BHS has PDN support in its own server, allowing it to participate directly in this cell alongside Alice and Bob — though an `o:Organization` is never itself a `c:member` subject, so what actually joins is `:BHS_Service`, the `s:ServiceProvider` the society provides, carrying `s:providedBy :BHS`. Alice maintains her BHS profile in [graph 14](<example/Cells/Groups/Boston Hub Society/Boston Hub Society.databook.md#graph-14>), Bob, another member, keeps his profile updated ([graph 3](<example/Cells/Groups/Boston Hub Society/Boston Hub Society.databook.md#graph-03>)), and BHS itself contributes the identity it presents as one of the cell's three parties — that graph's subject is `:BHS_Service`, but its claimant is `:BHS`, the organization, since the society is the party really making the claim — in [graph 1](<example/Cells/Groups/Boston Hub Society/Boston Hub Society.databook.md#graph-01>). BHS also claims the cell's one tool graph — its own organizational profile, recording that the society currently has 80 members and where its website lives ([graph 92](<example/Cells/Groups/Boston Hub Society/Boston Hub Society.databook.md#graph-92>)). That topic is what makes the cell's derived subject `:BHS` alone, rather than the set of all three member subjects (see integrity.md's Check 18). `bhscat:BostonHubSociety` declares a form tool, so its template cell names that shape up front — `c:formShape oshapes:OrganizationShape` — and every cell filed under it is expected to carry that tool of its own (see integrity.md's Check 31); the *Groups* scaffold cell above it satisfies that with a deliberately empty topic, since its real content lives down here in this leaf cell instead.

This cell is also the worked example of a **category extension**. Its `c:category` is not a concept of `cat:CategoryScheme` at all but `bhscat:BostonHubSociety`, published in `category-ext/boston-hub-society.ttl` — the society's own SKOS scheme, linked to the app's taxonomy by `skos:broadMatch cat:Groups` so that a recipient without the extension installed still knows to file an incoming cell under Groups. The extension's template cell names `bhsshapes:MemberShape` as its `c:memberShape`, making this the one cell in the example tree whose member graphs are validated against something other than `pshapes:ContactInfoShape`: the society's own two-page member directory form, which asks for schooling, industry, family, and career history alongside the usual contact details. Because the cell's name and its category both compress to `boston-hub-society`, its file is `Boston Hub Society.databook.md` with no parenthetical.

The bundle publishes four things, and `category.ttl` and `cat-templates.ttl` change for none of them:

| Term | What it is |
|---|---|
| `bhscat:BostonHubSocietyScheme` | the society's own `skos:ConceptScheme` |
| `bhscat:BostonHubSociety` | the concept, `skos:broadMatch cat:Groups` — so an app without the extension files the cell under Groups |
| `bhscat:BostonHubSocietyTemplateCell` | the template cell, naming `bhsshapes:MemberShape` as its `c:memberShape`; its declared tool is unchanged from `ctpl:GroupsTemplateCell`'s |
| `bhsshapes:MemberShape` | the member shape, in `category-ext/shacl/boston-hub-society-shacl.ttl` |

The extension introduces no vocabulary of its own — every field its shape constrains comes from CCO, `persona.ttl`, `persona-ext/directory-profile.ttl`, or `other/education.ttl`. What belongs to the society is the constraints: a FamilyName required exactly once where `pshapes:ContactInfoShape` requires none, `dp:industry` restricted to the form's 19 values, and at most one `education:EducationRecord` per level for its single High School and College rows. For the mechanism itself, see [Category Extensions](README.md#category-extensions).

The cell also carries the completed form itself as an **attachment** — `Personal Page for BHS 2026 Directory (Alice Walker).pdf`, which every member of the cell receives — that being all an attachment is. (In this repo's scaffolding it sits in the cell's own `_cell-attachments` folder.) Its answers are the same ones [graph 14](<example/Cells/Groups/Boston Hub Society/Boston Hub Society.databook.md#graph-14>) carries as RDF, field for field, so the cell holds the paper and the data side by side: the questions and Alice's handwritten answers in its Attachments area, the same answers structured and validated in its member graph.

Beside it, this cell is also the example tree's one worked case of the other half of that rule. Alice keeps `answers-draft.md` in the cell without attaching it — the notes she made while filling the form in: who to ask before naming them as her sponsor, which two of the society's 19 industry options she settled on, and three attempts at the goals question she was not happy with. Because she never attached it, it is private to her: it syncs to her own devices with the rest of her copy of the cell, and neither Bob nor `:BHS_Service` ever receives it, though both are members of this same cell. (In this repo's scaffolding it sits in a `Directory Drafts` subfolder of the cell's own folder, loose rather than in `_cell-attachments`.) The PDF and the draft sit one act apart and on opposite sides of what propagates — see [Cell Contents](app-behavior.md#cell-contents) in app-behavior.md.

<p align="center"><img src="example/images/groups.png" alt="Groups cells"></p>

### Chestnut Hill Village Association

The second cell in the same diagram is Alice's neighborhood association — the homeowners on the three streets that make up Chestnut Hill Village. It is filed under the same `cat:Groups` category as the Boston Hub Society, but it is the opposite case in one respect: the association runs no PDN node of its own, so nothing joins the cell on its behalf and Alice self-enters its profile herself. Its tool's topic — the association as an `o:Organization` in its own right, with the number of households it covers and its public website — is therefore claimed by `:Self` ([graph 101](<example/Cells/Groups/Chestnut Hill Village Association/Chestnut Hill Village Association(groups).databook.md#graph-101>)), where BHS claims its own equivalent (graph 92). Alongside Alice's own profile ([graph 9](<example/Cells/Groups/Chestnut Hill Village Association/Chestnut Hill Village Association(groups).databook.md#graph-09>)), two of her neighbors are members who keep their own profiles updated from their own instances of the app: Marcy ([graph 45](<example/Cells/Groups/Chestnut Hill Village Association/Chestnut Hill Village Association(groups).databook.md#graph-45>)) and Henry ([graph 100](<example/Cells/Groups/Chestnut Hill Village Association/Chestnut Hill Village Association(groups).databook.md#graph-100>)). The topic still governs the derived subject, so this cell is about `:CHVA` rather than about its three members (see integrity.md's Check 18). What the association actually does day to day — its recommended contractors (plumbers, electricians, lawn care and the like), the dates of its annual in-person meeting and its annual spring cleanup event, the name of the current president, and its annual dues — is free text rather than modeled data, and lives in the cell's [folder note](<example/Cells/Groups/Chestnut Hill Village Association/Chestnut Hill Village Association.md>) rather than in any of its graphs — the `X.md`-inside-folder-`X` file the app shows in its Note area (see app-behavior.md's [Note Area](app-behavior.md#note-area)). This is the one folder note the example tree materializes; every other cell here carries its content in graphs alone.

### Planning a Trip with an Agent

Alice is planning a trip with her spouse Dave, and invites her own AI travel agent to help. Under a *Travel* cell (a purely organizational category node, like *Things*) she has created a *Trips* cell (also purely organizational, reusing its parent's own `cat:Travel` category) and, nested inside it, a cell for this specific trip — *Kyoto Trip 2027* (reusing its immediate parent *Trips*'s own `cat:Trips` category, the same "child folder reuses its parent's category" pattern the *Ginger* and *RAV4* cells already use). Alice's travel agent (`s:ChatGPT`) joins this cell as a real member alongside Alice and Dave — not as an invisible tool — giving it its own self-claimed `c:member` graph (see [graph 67](<example/Cells/Travel/Trips/Kyoto Trip 2027/Kyoto Trip 2027(trips).databook.md#graph-67>)) carrying `s:actsFor :Self`. Three distinct members (Self, Dave, and the agent) make this a three-member cell.

The trip itself is backed by one form tool whose topic is `:Kyoto_Trip_2027`, holding three graphs, one per member, each claimed from a different side: Alice's own basic claim identifying the trip ([graph 69](<example/Cells/Travel/Trips/Kyoto Trip 2027/Kyoto Trip 2027(trips).databook.md#graph-69>)), her agent's own evolving, collaboratively-drafted itinerary ([graph 70](<example/Cells/Travel/Trips/Kyoto Trip 2027/Kyoto Trip 2027(trips).databook.md#graph-70>)), and Dave's own contribution ([graph 91](<example/Cells/Travel/Trips/Kyoto Trip 2027/Kyoto Trip 2027(trips).databook.md#graph-91>)) — reaching `c:formGraph`'s real upper bound of one graph per member (see README.md's [Tools](README.md#tools) section), and extending the same "one topic, multiple claimants" pattern the Medical Appointment cell's two "Med. Appt mt." squares already illustrate (see [Representative Cells](README.md#representative-cells)). The agent's own graph is revised in place turn by turn as Alice chats back and forth with it, rather than replaced by a new graph each time (see app-behavior.md's [The Iterative Prompt/Response Loop](app-behavior.md#the-iterative-promptresponse-loop)).

### Travel Providers

Alongside her trips, Alice keeps a cell per travel provider she books with, under a *Provider* cell (`cat:TravelProvider`) nested in the same *Travel* cell. Her [Hilton](<example/Cells/Travel/Provider/Hilton/Hilton(travel-provider).databook.md>) cell is the one worked example: a single form tool ([graph 84](<example/Cells/Travel/Provider/Hilton/Hilton(travel-provider).databook.md#graph-84>)) carrying her Hilton Honors account — username, password, service URI, and `sa:loyaltyProgramID`, her membership number. `cat:TravelProvider` declares a form tool carrying `c:formShape sashapes:ServiceAccountShape`, so that tool is template-driven: [Lazy Instantiation](app-behavior.md#lazy-instantiation) gives the cell the tool from the start and stamps the graph's `c:shape` straight from that shape. The parent *Provider* cell is a scaffold, so it carries the same required topic ([graph 56](<example/Cells/Travel/Provider/Provider(travel-provider).databook.md#graph-56>)) deliberately empty — its real content lives in the leaf cell instead, exactly as *Trips* does above.

The cell carries no tag at all, and needs none: `sa:loyaltyProgramID` in its own topic graph is what makes it findable. Asking for every cell where Alice holds a loyalty program is a search for that property, which returns this cell without anyone having had to label it — see [Finding Cells by Property](app-behavior.md#finding-cells-by-property) in app-behavior.md, and [Tags](README.md#tags) for the cases a property search cannot reach.

## Diagrams

`helpers/draw.py` generates a Mermaid (`.mmd`) and PNG diagram for a single embedded graph, given its owning cell DataBook file and its id (or id local-name):

```bash
python3 helpers/draw.py "example/Cells/Finances/Banking & Payments Firms/Citibank/Citibank(banking-payments).databook.md" "graph-76"
python3 helpers/draw.py "example/Cells/Home/Paradise/Paradise(home).databook.md" "graph-18"
```

Both output files are always written to `example/graphs/images/` (must be run from the repo root), keyed by the graph's own id local-name.

**Dependencies** (one-time setup):
```bash
pip install rdflib pyyaml
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

Each diagram shows the `p:Person` individual (yellow), supporting named individuals (white boxes), class labels (plain text), blank-node designator chains, and literal values (green).

## Validation

Validation requires [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) (`riot`, `shacl`), plus `pyyaml` and `rdflib` for the `helpers/` scripts (`pip install pyyaml rdflib`). All Turtle extraction happens in-repo, through one fence parser (`databook_graphs.iter_graph_blocks()`): `helpers/validate.py` uses it directly, `helpers/extract-graph.py` isolates a single embedded graph, and `helpers/extract-all.py` concatenates every graph in the tree. The [DataBook CLI](https://github.com/kurtcagle/databook) (`databook`; install: `git clone https://github.com/kurtcagle/databook.git && cd databook && npm install && npm install -g .`) is optional — needed only for the Quick check below, never by validation. SHACL shapes remain plain Turtle (`.ttl`).

### Quick check — DataBook syntax (optional, requires the DataBook CLI)

Verify that every DataBook file has valid YAML frontmatter and well-formed block annotations:

```bash
find example -name "*.databook.md" -not -path "*/under-development/*" -print0 | sort -z |
while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do
  databook head "$f" -q > /dev/null || echo "FAIL: $f"
done
```

A file that fails here is likely to yield no Turtle when `helpers/validate.py` extracts it either, causing downstream `riot` or SHACL errors that are harder to trace. (Uses `-print0`/`read -d ''` rather than `for f in $(find ...)` — cell DataBook paths under `example/Cells/` routinely contain spaces, e.g. `Banking & Payments Firms`, which word-splitting would otherwise silently break.)

### Running it

Everything is one script, run from the repo root:

```bash
python3 helpers/validate.py
```

It walks every cell-databook under `example/Cells/` (skipping `under-development/`) and validates
**each cell in isolation from every other cell** — no two cells' data ever reach the same
`shacl validate` call. That isolation is the whole point: every graph re-asserts shared individuals
such as `:Self` under the self-containment convention, so merging all cells into one graph would
union facts that were never meant to co-exist and manufacture violations no real query would ever
see. (README's [Named Graph Scoping](README.md#named-graph-scoping-and-graph-specific-membership) makes the same point about
queries.) The shared foundation and application ontologies it merges in are schema, not another
cell's instance data, so merging those in doesn't break the isolation.

Each cell gets two passes.

**1 — the cell pass.** The cell's whole content at once: every one of its embedded graphs' Turtle,
plus the `c:` triples synthesized from its own `v4.*` frontmatter
(`databook_graphs.process_cell_databook()`). This is validated against the four general shapes
files — `shacl/cell-shacl.ttl` (the cell model itself: `c:category` cardinality, the
`c:TemplateCell`/`c:InstanceCell` split, `c:creator`/`c:owner`/`c:member`/`c:tool`, and
`c:CGraph`'s `c:claimant` and `c:MemberGraph`'s `c:subject`), plus `shacl/persona-shacl.ttl`,
`shacl/organization-shacl.ttl` and `shacl/service-shacl.ttl` — merged into one shapes graph with
`owl:imports` stripped. The graph Turtle has to be in this data, not just the frontmatter triples:
`:InstanceCellShape` and `:CGraphShape` constrain `c:creator`/`c:owner`/`c:claimant` with
`sh:or ( [sh:class p:Person] [sh:class o:Organization] … )`, and those individuals are typed only
in the graph Turtle.

**2 — the template pass.** Each graph carrying a `template:` value, checked on its own against the
shape that value names. Driven entirely by data already in each cell-databook's own
`v4.member[]`/`v4.tool[].graph[]` entries — there is no hand-maintained per-graph command list to keep in
sync. Since `c:shape`'s range is `sh:NodeShape` (`cell.ttl`), the value already *names the shape
itself* (e.g. `idocshapes:PassportShape`), with no label-to-shape resolution; the only work left is
locating which physical `*-shacl.ttl` file defines a shape of that name — `pshapes:` shapes are
split across `shacl/persona-shacl.ttl` and `shacl/contactinfo-shacl.ttl` — done via the
`SHAPE_TO_FILE` table in the script. A graph with no `template:` value needs no per-template
validation and is skipped outright.

Every resolved template shape is additionally scoped at runtime so it can't fire on an individual
outside the one graph being checked: every *other* shape co-located in the same physical shapes file
is deactivated for that call, and — for the one class broad enough to risk an incidental same-type
individual within a single isolated graph, `p:Person` (targeted by `ContactInfoShape`) — the
shape is re-targeted (`sh:targetNode`) at only the *substantive* `p:Person` individual(s) actually
present in the graph (one carrying real content, not just the bare `rdf:type` triple the
self-containment convention re-asserts on every referenced individual). Every other template's shape
already targets a narrow, specific document/account class with no such risk, so it keeps its own
original targeting.

The two passes use **different base merges**. `cat-templates.ttl` is in the template pass's base but
deliberately out of the cell pass's, so `cell-shacl`'s `:CellShape` can't fire on the 102
`ctpl:*TemplateCell` individuals — generic class-level content bound to no real person, and not what
a cell-databook's own validation is about. Both bases are built once per run, not once per cell.

Sample output (abridged):

```
OK       example/Cells/Companies/Google/Google(companies).databook.md [cell]
OK       example/Cells/Companies/Google/Google(companies).databook.md graph-16 [pshapes:ContactInfoShape]
OK       example/Cells/Companies/Google/Google(companies).databook.md graph-73 [sashapes:ServiceAccountShape]
OK       example/Cells/Government/Federal/Passport/Passport.databook.md [cell]
OK       example/Cells/Government/Federal/Passport/Passport.databook.md graph-81 [idocshapes:PassportShape]
...

Cells: 46   Checked: 81   Skipped (no template): 9   Violations: 0   Unresolved: 0
```

The script exits non-zero if any cell or checked graph reports a violation (or a `template:` value's
shape has no entry in the `SHAPE_TO_FILE` table), so it doubles as a CI-style gate.

### Merged whole-tree dump

Validation never merges the whole tree, but a few things legitimately need the union — notably
integrity.md's Check 4 ("no orphan Persons"), whose reachability question only makes sense across every
cell at once, and loading the example into a triplestore for ad-hoc SPARQL. To produce it:

```bash
python3 helpers/extract-all.py example > /tmp/v4-data.ttl   # every embedded graph's turtle
python3 helpers/yaml-to-rdf.py . > /tmp/v4-yaml.ttl         # the c: triples from every cell's frontmatter
riot --output=turtle /tmp/v4-data.ttl /tmp/v4-yaml.ttl > /tmp/v4-merged.ttl
```

Do **not** run the general SHACL shapes against this merged file — that is exactly the global-merge
mistake described above.
