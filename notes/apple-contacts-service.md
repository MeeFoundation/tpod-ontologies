# Apple Contacts Tool Notes

## Overview

Apple Contacts is a **tool** (`pod:Contacts`), not a service: the module never joins a pod as a member, it backs a capability the pod carries. See app-behavior.md's Tool Modules section.

Tellipod is a strict superset of Apple Contacts in every dimension. This means importing from Apple Contacts into the app is straightforward, but exporting from the app back to Apple Contacts requires explicit design decisions. Round-tripping losslessly is achievable but requires an anchor strategy (see below).

There are two levels to address:

---

## Level 1: Contacts ↔ Graphs

Apple Contacts' core design assumption is **one card per person**, with all graphs flattened into it. vCard accommodates multiple graphs by allowing optional labels on repeatable fields — a person can have two email addresses, one labeled `work` and one labeled `home`. This is vCard's mechanism for expressing graph.

The app follows the same design assumption. When exporting a person to Apple Contacts, **all N of that person's graphs are merged into a single vCard**. Each field value carries the label from the graph it came from (e.g. a phone number from a work graph gets the `work` label). If two different work graphs both contribute a phone number, the vCard will have two `work` phone numbers — this is correct and consistent with how vCard works.

**Import (Apple Contacts → the app):** each contact record becomes a graph DataBook. All standard vCard fields have direct counterparts in the persona ontology: names, phone numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, organization, job title, birthday, anniversary, photo, notes, social profiles, URLs, related names.

**Export (the app → Apple Contacts):** merge all graphs for the person into a single vCard. Map each field's graph (work, personal, family, etc.) to the corresponding vCard label. Multiple values under the same label are permitted and expected.

### vCard label constraints

**Number of values:** the vCard spec (RFC 6350) imposes no maximum on repeatable properties — `TEL`, `EMAIL`, `ADR` etc. can appear as many times as needed. Apple Contacts also imposes no hard cap in its data model. A person with phone numbers across many graphs will export cleanly regardless of count.

**Label string length:** vCard's `TYPE` parameter supports predefined types (`work`, `home`, `pod`, etc.) and custom types, stored with an `X-` prefix in vCard 3.0 (e.g. `TYPE=X-Acme-Corp`) or as free strings in vCard 4.0. The vCard spec sets no maximum length for `TYPE` values. However, Apple Contacts has an undocumented practical limit on how much of a custom label it displays in the UI — long labels (e.g. `"Boston Hub Society"`, `"California DMV"`) may be truncated visually even though the full string is preserved in the underlying vCard data. Round-trip fidelity of the data is unaffected; this is purely a display concern.

This display truncation limit is not publicly documented by Apple and likely varies by OS version. It should be verified empirically once an early implementation exists.

## Level 2: Groups ↔ Hidden Service Tags

An Apple Contacts **group** is not a category, not a topic, and not a member, so it does not map onto the pod tree at all. The module records it instead as a [hidden service tag](../README.md#tags) on the contact's own pod — `pod:serviceTag`, namespace `foundation.mee.applecontacts`, key `group`, value the group's name verbatim.

**Import (Apple Contacts → the app):** for each group a contact belongs to, write one tag. A contact in three groups gets three tags sharing one namespace and one key, differing only in value — which is exactly what a namespace/key pair is allowed to repeat for. Where the contact's pod is filed is decided independently, by the ordinary auto-filing heuristic; no pod is created, moved, or reclassified on account of a group.

**Export (the app → Apple Contacts):** read back every tag in this module's namespace with key `group` and re-create the contact's group membership from the values.

There is no flattening to do in either direction. Because a group never corresponds to a position in the pod tree, no hierarchy has to be encoded on the way out or reconstructed on the way back in — the group name round-trips verbatim, and a group name that happens to contain a `/` is just a group name, since the tag's structure lives in its sibling properties rather than inside the value.

**Rename safety:** matching is by name, so a group renamed on the Apple side reads as a new group, leaving the old tag stale. A module that wants to survive renames stores the group's own identifier alongside the name under a second key — `groupID` — which is precisely what having a key rather than one opaque string buys.

Note that these tags never propagate when a pod is shared: they are one member's own module's bookkeeping, and a member running a different servicn, or none, could not interpret them.

## Anchor Strategy (Key to Losslessness)

vCard supports custom extension fields (`X-` prefix). Storing app IRIs in these fields lets the app re-identify records on re-import without duplication or drift:

- `X-TPOD-PERSON-IRI` on a contact record — points to the `p:Person` individual IRI

Groups need no anchor field of their own: the hidden service tag already holds the group's name verbatim on the pod, and re-identification is by that value (see the rename-safety note above for when a `groupID` tag is worth writing alongside it).

These fields are ignored by Apple Contacts and other vCard consumers but survive export/import cycles, making true lossless round-tripping achievable.

## Summary

| Dimension | Import | Export | Lossless? |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Contact fields | Direct field mapping | Merge all graphs into one vCard | Yes, with `X-TPOD-PERSON-IRI` anchor |
| Multiple graphs per person | Each → a separate graph embedded in the person's pod DataBook | Flatten to single vCard; multiple values per label are correct | Yes |
| Group membership | Each group → one hidden service tag on the pod | Tags in this module's namespace with key `group` → group membership | Yes — the group name round-trips verbatim |
| App-specific metadata | Stored in graph DataBook | Store IRI in `X-TPOD-*` vCard field | Yes, with anchor fields |
