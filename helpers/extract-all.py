"""
extract-all.py — print every embedded graph's fenced turtle block, across
every cell-databook under a root directory, as one merged Turtle stream.

Why this exists: validation never merges the whole tree — `helpers/validate.py`
works one cell at a time on purpose — but a few things legitimately need the
union: integrity.md's TTL-1 ("no orphan Persons"), whose reachability question
only makes sense across every cell at once, and loading the example into a
triplestore for ad-hoc SPARQL. See example.md's "Merged whole-tree dump".

Do NOT run the general SHACL shapes against this output: merging every cell
unions facts the self-containment convention deliberately keeps per-graph,
which manufactures violations no real query would ever see.

It shares `databook_graphs.iter_graph_blocks()` with extract-graph.py and
validate.py, so every reader of the fence format uses one implementation.

Files under any directory named `under-development/` are skipped, matching
every integrity check's own scope (CLAUDE.md).

Usage:  python3 helpers/extract-all.py [root]     # root defaults to "example"
Output: the concatenated raw Turtle content of every embedded graph.
