validate.py — the project's SHACL validation, run one pod at a time.

Every pod-databook under example/Pods/ is validated in isolation from every
other pod: no two pods' extracted data ever reach the same `shacl validate`
call. (The shared foundation/application ontologies merged in below are
schema, not another pod's instance data, so merging those in doesn't violate
this.) Isolation is the whole point — every graph re-asserts shared
individuals such as `:Self` under the self-containment convention, so a
global merge would union facts that were never meant to co-exist and
manufacture violations that no real query would ever see (README.md's "Named Graph Scoping
and Graph-Specific Membership" makes the same point about queries).

Each pod gets two passes:

1. **Pod pass** — the pod's whole content at once: every one of its
   embedded graphs' Turtle, plus the `pod:` triples synthesized from its own
   `v4.*` frontmatter (databook_graphs.process_pod_databook). Validated
   against the four general shapes files — pod-shacl (the pod model
   itself), persona-shacl, organization-shacl, service-shacl. The graph Turtle
   has to be in here, not just the frontmatter triples: pod-shacl's
   :InstancePodShape constrains creator/owner with `sh:class p:Person` and
   :CGraphShape constrains claimant with
   `sh:or ( [sh:class p:Person] [sh:class o:Organization] [sh:class service:Service] )`,
   and those individuals are typed only in the graph Turtle.

2. **Template pass** — each graph that carries a `shape:` value, checked
   on its own against the shape that value names. A graph's `shape:` is
   the *sole* indicator of what to validate it against, and since
   `pod:shape`'s range is `sh:NodeShape` (pod.ttl) the value already
   *names the shape itself* (e.g. `idocshapes:PassportShape`), with no
   label-to-shape resolution step. The only work left is locating which
   physical `*-shacl.ttl` file defines a shape of that name — since
   `pshapes:` shapes are split across two files — done via the SHAPE_TO_FILE
   table below. A graph with no `shape:` value is skipped outright.

The two passes use different base merges. pod-category-templates.ttl is in the
template pass's base but deliberately out of the pod pass's, so pod-shacl
can't fire on the 102 ctpl:*TemplatePod individuals, which are generic
class-level content bound to no real person.

Root-cause scoping fix (template pass): a class-wide shape targeting `persona:Person` directly
— in practice only `ContactInfoShape`, since every other template's
shape targets a narrow, specific document/account class that only the one
real individual per graph is ever typed as — would otherwise fire on *every*
`persona:Person` individual present in a graph's merged test data, including
an incidental one such as the bare `:Self rdf:type ... persona:Person` every
graph re-asserts under the self-containment convention, which is not the
graph's own real subject and may legitimately lack a GivenName.

The graph's own YAML `subject:` isn't a safe stand-in for "the individual
to validate" here either — a member graph's `subject` can legitimately name
a non-`persona:Person` party (e.g. a Kyoto trip's agent member has
`subject: ":Alice_Travel_Agent"`, a `service:ChatGPT`, while the real
ContactInfo-conformant content is asserted on `:Self` in that same graph). So whenever the resolved
shape's own declared target is exactly `sh:targetClass persona:Person`,
`scope_shape` (below) instead re-targets it at every *substantive*
`persona:Person` individual actually present in the graph's own extracted
data — one that carries at least one property beyond the bare `rdf:type`
triple the self-containment convention re-asserts — via `sh:targetNode`,
excluding any bare, data-free mention. Every *other* template's shape keeps
its own original targeting untouched — a narrow document/account class has no
such incidental-mention risk, so rewriting those would misfire, not fix
anything (e.g. `identitydocuments:Passport` is asserted on a reified
`:Alice_US_Passport` individual, never on the graph's own `subject`, `:Self`).
In every case, every *other* root shape co-located in the same physical
shapes file is also stripped of its own targeting for that one validate
call, so it can't spuriously fire on the same merged data either.

Usage:   python3 helpers/validate.py
Exit:    0 if every checked graph conforms, 1 if any graph reports a
         violation or a template's shape name has no entry in SHAPE_TO_FILE.
