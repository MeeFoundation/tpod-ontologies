"""Regenerate README.md's Form Shapes table from the ontology.

A form type *is* a SHACL node shape: the Add Tool dialog offers one entry per
shape a tool's graph can be validated against, and the picked shape's IRI is
stamped onto the new graph as its pod:shape value (app-behavior.md's "Adding a
Tool"); README.md's "Form Shapes" section is where the list itself lives. Which shapes those are, and which categories declare one up front via
pod:formShape, are both facts of the .ttl files — so the table's row set, its
shape column and its "Declared by" column are generated here rather than
maintained by hand.

What this script owns, and what it deliberately does not:

  * Owns the ROW SET. The shapes a graph may name are exactly the keys of
    helpers/validate.py's SHAPE_TO_FILE registry — the same registry the
    validator resolves a pod:shape value against — minus any shape that
    appears only as a template's pod:memberShape and never as a
    pod:formShape (bhsshapes:MemberShape is today's only one: it governs a
    category extension's member graphs, not a form). Component shapes that
    validate a node nested inside a form (:BodyWeightShape, :MedicationShape,
    :OdometerReadingShape and the rest) are already outside that registry and
    so never appear here.
  * Owns the SHAPE column (the CURIE) and the DECLARED BY column (every
    category whose pod:TemplatePod names that shape as a pod:formShape, in
    cat-templates.ttl or in a category-ext/ bundle).
  * Does NOT own the display name or the description. Those are the app's own
    UI wording, not derivable from a shape's local name, so a surviving row
    keeps the text already in the file and a newly-added row is emitted with a
    TODO for a human (or Claude, via /sync-form-types) to write. --report
    prints the facts to write it from.

Row order is preserved for surviving rows — the table's grouping is editorial —
with new rows appended at the end, so the generated block diffs cleanly.

Usage (from the repo root):
    python3 helpers/form-types.py            # same as --check
    python3 helpers/form-types.py --check    # diff the file against the ontology; exit 1 on drift
    python3 helpers/form-types.py --write    # splice the regenerated table into README.md
    python3 helpers/form-types.py --report   # per-shape facts for writing a description
