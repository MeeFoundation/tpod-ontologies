"""
databook_graphs.py — shared helpers for reading pod-databook files: locating
one embedded graph's content inside a (possibly multi-graph) file, and turning
a pod's own frontmatter into `pod:` triples. Used by draw.py,
extract-graph.py, extract-all.py, yaml-to-rdf.py and validate.py.

Since graph-databooks were merged into their owning pod-databooks, a pod
file's body may contain several ```turtle fences — one per embedded graph
(each `v4.member`/`v4.tool[].graph` entry in that pod's frontmatter is one such
graph's own metadata dict). Each fence still carries its own
`<!-- databook:graph: {graph_id}#graph -->` marker, computed from the
graph's own `id` per the unchanged `{id}#graph` named-graph convention
(pod-databook.md's "Graph Ids and Named Graphs") — so isolating one graph's fence
only requires knowing that graph's `id`, no new marker scheme.

Also carries `resolve()`/`as_list()` — needed wherever a `v4.*` YAML value
(a CURIE or a bare `:X` local name) must become the same full IRI — and the
`pod:` triple synthesis (`process_pod_databook()`/`process_embedded_graph()`)
that turns one pod-databook's frontmatter into Turtle. Both `yaml-to-rdf.py`
(whole-tree dump) and `validate.py` (one pod at a time) call that synthesis,
so it lives here rather than in either script; `yaml-to-rdf.py`'s hyphenated
filename is not an importable module name in any case.
