# Storage

V4 persists **no data in the user's filesystem**. Every pod and everything in it lives in a
protected, app-managed store, encrypted at rest.

This document is the canonical statement of that decision and of what follows from it — in
particular, which parts of this repository are real v4 and which are development scaffolding. It is
linked from [README.md](README.md), [app-behavior.md](app-behavior.md),
[pod-databook.md](pod-databook.md) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), which describe the model itself and
point here rather than restating any of this.

## The decision

A pod's entire content is app-internal: its members, tools, graphs, category, tags, name and id,
together with its note, its attachments, its chat, and a member's own private files. None of it is
written to the filesystem, in any form, at any point. There is no folder representing a pod, no
file representing its note, and no directory holding its attachments.

The store sits alongside the pod's membership store — the append-only event log whose first entry
is the pod's founding event (see [Pod Id](pod-databook.md#pod-id) in pod-databook.md) — rather
than parallel to it. As before, no pod is ever stored by any cloud provider, or any third party of
any kind, including The Mee Foundation; it is held on the user's own device(s), or, for an
organization's own `s:ServiceProvider`, on Personal Data Network (PDN) nodes hosted by that
organization.

## Why

**Crash consistency.** Getting durability and consistency right on top of ordinary files is far
harder than it looks — the failure modes are numerous, poorly documented, and inconsistent across
filesystems and platforms. Dan Luu's [survey of file-consistency
bugs](https://danluu.com/file-consistency/) collects the evidence. A single store the app controls
end to end is the tractable version of the problem.

**Security, which is the product's whole point.** V4 exists so that two people can share information
directly, end-to-end encrypted, with no corporate intermediary in the middle. Data transmission was
already built to that standard. Leaving the same content sitting as plaintext files in the user's
filesystem — where any other process, sync client, backup agent or indexer on the machine can read
it — undercuts exactly the guarantee the transport layer provides. The risk is not acceptable for
notes, and it is not acceptable for attachments either. Encryption at rest is therefore a property
of *all* v4 data, with no carve-out for the unstructured parts.

## What this changes, and what it does not

The model is unaffected. What changes is where it lives and how some of its rules are justified.

- **What a pod is.** A pod is a unit the app manages, identified by its own stable id. Nothing
  marks it in a filesystem, because it is not in one. The reserved `_pod-attachments` folder that
  once served as that marker is a scaffolding convention only (see below).
- **Tree position.** `pod:Pod` still asserts no tree position, exactly as before — but the reason is
  now that a pod's parent is per-member state in that member's own store, never shared content.
  This is what lets two members of a shared pod each file it wherever they like without touching
  what the other sees.
- **A pod's name.** The app's own record of the name is authoritative outright; there is no folder
  for it to mirror. The rules around it are unchanged — sibling uniqueness with auto-suffixing, and
  which pods share a name across members versus keeping one per member (see
  [Naming, Renaming, and Sharing](app-behavior.md#naming-renaming-and-sharing) in app-behavior.md).
- **Attachments versus private files.** The distinction survives in full, as a rule about
  *propagation* rather than about directories: an attachment is content every member receives, and a
  private file stays in one member's copy and reaches no one else. What changes is only that the two
  are told apart by how the member filed them in the app, not by which directory they sit in.
- **The note.** Still exactly one per pod, still Markdown, still supporting `[[wikilinks]]` that
  resolve by target pod id. It is no longer a file, so the folder-note convention that once tied it
  to a filename is gone.
- **PKM vault interoperability is retired.** Running v4's storage as, or alongside, an Obsidian-style
  vault was a consequence of keeping notes and attachments as ordinary files in ordinary folders.
  With the files gone, so is the property. The note's Markdown and the wikilink syntax remain, for
  their own reasons.

## What is real v4, and what is scaffolding

The app does not exist yet. This repository develops the ontologies for it and documents the use
cases they have to serve, and it needs real content to do that against — so it carries a worked
example on disk, in the only form available to a repository. **That on-disk form is development
scaffolding in its entirety**: not merely the `.databook.md` files, but the folder layout around
them too.

| Ships as v4 | Development scaffolding |
|---|---|
| Every `*.ttl` ontology — `persona.ttl`, `pod.ttl`, `pod-categories.ttl`, `pod-category-templates.ttl`, `service.ttl`, `organization.ttl`, and every `other/`, `persona-ext/` and `pod-category-ext/` peer file (possibly expressed differently in the app) | Every `*.databook.md` file, and the whole format specified in [pod-databook.md](pod-databook.md) |
| Every `**/shacl/*.ttl` shapes file | The `example/Pods/` tree, and every folder in it |
| The concepts the ontologies model — pods, members, owners, tools, graphs, categories, tags, notes, attachments, chat | Pods as folders; the `_pod-attachments` marker; folder notes named after their folder; private files as loose files; pass-through directories; the filename convention |
| The app-level rules in [app-behavior.md](app-behavior.md) — lifecycle, sharing, permissions, naming, filing | The `helpers/` scripts, and the [integrity.md](integrity.md) checks that walk the tree on disk |

The scaffolding is genuinely useful and is not going away before the app arrives: it is how the
ontologies get exercised, validated and diagrammed against real content, and it is a diagnostic
independent of any implementation. But nothing in it is a commitment about how v4 stores anything.
Where a document in this repo describes a folder, a filename, or a file on disk, it is describing
this repository — see [Development Scaffolding](pod-databook.md#development-scaffolding) in
pod-databook.md for the detailed account, and
[Scaffolding: This Repo's Filesystem Tree](app-behavior.md#scaffolding-this-repos-filesystem-tree)
in app-behavior.md for the picture of it.
