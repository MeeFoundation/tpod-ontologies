# Integrity Checks

This file holds the project's integrity checks, split out of [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) to keep that file smaller. Everything else about the project — the ontologies, file layout, naming conventions, and architectural patterns these checks refer to — is documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

Files inside any directory named `under-development/` (at any depth) are works-in-progress and must be **excluded from all integrity checks** below.

After any change to a graph (its `tpod.member` entry or `tpod.tool[].graph` entry, or its `### Graph NN` body section) or a pod DataBook, verify the following.

## The four kinds

Checks are grouped by **what the check reads**, and numbered from 1 within each kind. The kind prefix is part of the identifier — `PNG-9`, `TTL-3`, `YAML-6`, `FS-5` — so no two checks ever share a number and the name alone says what a check looks at.

| Kind | Reads | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **PNG-n** | a diagram image — its pixels, or the drawing compared by eye against the data | 11 (+8 sub-checks) |
| **TTL-n** | a `.ttl` file, asking about triples; parses with `rdflib` | 8 |
| **YAML-n** | a pod DataBook's YAML frontmatter and Markdown body, as written | 9 |
| **FS-n** | the filesystem, and the documentation prose that refers to it | 6 |

A check that reads two kinds is filed under its **primary** input — the one that makes it the check it is — and says so in its own text. `TTL-2` also reads DataBook YAML; `YAML-5` also reads folder names.

## Running the checks

Run them **kind by kind**, announcing the kind and then working through its checks in order: PNG-1, PNG-2, … then TTL-1, TTL-2, … and so on. Reporting follows the same shape, so a result reads `TTL-3 PASS` and a failure is located by its kind before its number. Within PNG-1, the sub-checks run in letter order (PNG-1a … PNG-1h).

Not every check is automatable. Every PNG check except PNG-10 and PNG-11 is visual — the script under it prints the correct values for cross-reference rather than comparing the image — as are PNG-2's diagram direction and a few others that say so in their own text. Run the scripts; read the rest.

## Which checks use `rdflib`

A check that asks a question about **triples** parses with `rdflib`: every `TTL-n` check, and no other. Regex over Turtle reads documentation as data — it cannot tell an assertion from the same words inside an `rdfs:comment`, and `pod-category-templates.ttl`'s own `ctpl:UserDefinedTemplatePod` comment cites `?tc pod:category podcat:X` as prose, which the former regexes duly extracted as a category named `X` whose member shape was the sentence fragment `pshapes:ContactInfoShape — a Custom pod has no document type and no`. Harmless only by luck.

Every other kind **must not** use `rdflib`, because it asks about something that is not a graph and that parsing would normalize away. `YAML-9` is the clearest case — it hunts a non-string YAML sub-value, an entry that isn't a mapping, an extra sub-key and a repeated `(namespace, key, value)`, all of which synthesis would coerce, drop, or collapse into a set. `YAML-1` compares an id's zero-padding against its `### Graph NN` heading and `<a id=>` anchor, a serialization fact no graph retains. Converting either would make it strictly weaker.

`rdflib` is already required by `helpers/draw.py` and `helpers/validate.py`, so it adds nothing to install, and parsing every ontology and shapes file in the repo takes about 0.1s.

## Scaffolding checks

Many checks read the filesystem — the tree under `example/Pods/`, the `*.databook.md` files in it, and the PNGs under `example/graphs/images/`. All of that is **development scaffolding**: Tellipod persists no data in the user's filesystem at all (see [storage.md](storage.md)), and the on-disk tree exists only so that real pod content can be carried, validated and diagrammed before there is an app to hold it. Every `FS-n` check is a scaffolding check in that sense, along with `YAML-5`, `PNG-9`, `PNG-1a`, `PNG-1b` and `PNG-1e`: they keep this repo internally consistent and say nothing about how a running Tellipod stores anything. The rest test content that survives unchanged whatever the app does.

## Renumbering

These checks were previously numbered in one flat sequence, `Check 1` … `Check 39`, with several numbers retired and left unused. That scheme is gone: identifiers are now kind-prefixed and start at 1 within each kind. The old flat numbers map as follows, and no longer appear anywhere:

Check 10 → `PNG-1` · Check 10a → `PNG-1a` · Check 10b → `PNG-1b` · Check 10c → `PNG-1c` · Check 10d → `PNG-1d` · Check 10e → `PNG-1e` · Check 10g → `PNG-1f` · Check 10h → `PNG-1g` · Check 10i → `PNG-1h` · Check 1 → `PNG-2` · Check 12 → `PNG-3` · Check 13 → `PNG-4` · Check 14 → `PNG-5` · Check 37 → `PNG-6` · Check 38 → `PNG-7` · Check 15 → `PNG-8` · Check 20 → `PNG-9` · Check 33 → `PNG-10` · Check 34 → `PNG-11` · Check 4 → `TTL-1` · Check 16 → `TTL-2` · Check 26 → `TTL-3` · Check 27 → `TTL-4` · Check 28 → `TTL-5` · Check 29 → `TTL-6` · Check 30 → `TTL-7` · Check 39 → `TTL-8` · Check 2 → `YAML-1` · Check 3 → `YAML-2` · Check 9 → `YAML-3` · Check 18 → `YAML-4` · Check 19 → `YAML-5` · Check 21 → `YAML-6` · Check 23 → `YAML-7` · Check 25 → `YAML-8` · Check 36 → `YAML-9` · Check 5 → `FS-1` · Check 6 → `FS-2` · Check 7 → `FS-3` · Check 8 → `FS-4` · Check 11 → `FS-5` · Check 35 → `FS-6`

Retired checks `17`, `22`, `24`, `31`, `32` and sub-check `10f` had already been removed under the old scheme and have no counterpart here.

## PNG — diagram checks

These read a **PNG**: either its pixels, or the drawing itself compared by eye against the data it depicts. They are the largest group because most of this project's conventions are expressed in a diagram first. Most are visual — the script under each one prints the correct values for cross-reference rather than comparing the image automatically.


**PNG-1 — Example pod diagrams are authoritative**: The 12 pod diagrams in `example/images/` are the authoritative source of truth for the example pod tree. When any discrepancy is found between a diagram and the DataBook files, the diagram wins — update the DataBooks to match, not the other way around. Each diagram box corresponds to a pod in `example/Pods/` (a folder holding its one `pod-databook` directly inside it, box label = the pod's own folder name, mirrored in its pod-databook's `title:`). After any change to `example/Pods/` DataBooks or to the 12 diagrams, verify all of the following:

- **PNG-1a — Every pod box has a pod DataBook**: Every pod box shown in any of the 12 diagrams must have a corresponding pod in `example/Pods/` whose pod-databook's `title:` matches the box label. If a box has no DataBook, create the pod (folder + pod DataBook).

- **PNG-1b — Every pod DataBook has a diagram box**: Every pod's pod-databook in `example/Pods/` (except the top-level `example/Pods/` folder's own pod-databook, `Pods(person).databook.md`, which is the invisible root) must appear as a visible box in at least one of the 12 diagrams. If a DataBook has no corresponding box, either add it to the appropriate diagram or delete that pod's DataBook.

- **PNG-1c — A pod box's graph shapes match its DataBook's `member`/`tool` links exactly, both in count and in type**: Shape, not fill, is what distinguishes a `pod:member` graph from a tool's own graph — a square for a tool graph, and for a `member` graph either a circle, when its subject is a human (`p:Person`), or an octagon, when its subject is an `s:Service`. Fill/outline color is a separate, independent fact showing only who claimed that graph — see PNG-8's legend and PNG-10. For the count and field checks below, circles and octagons both count as member shapes: the circle/octagon split is a further fact about *that member's own identity type*, orthogonal to which list the graph is filed in. For every pod box that draws graph shapes at all (a purely organizational scaffold pod's box draws none — see PNG-1g): (1) the total number of shapes attached to it (circles plus squares together) must equal the total number of that pod-databook's own `tpod.member` entries plus the graphs nested under all its `tpod.tool` entries — no more, no fewer; (2) every circle's own numbered label must correspond to a `tpod.member` entry, and every square's own numbered label must correspond to one of a tool's own graphs — never the reverse. A pod's several tools are not distinguished by shape: every tool graph is a square regardless of which tool holds it. This is a visual check (no automated image parsing), but the script below prints every pod's own member/tool graph numbers, split by field, for direct cross-reference against whichever diagram box is being checked — e.g. `pets.png`'s "Ginger" box shows one circle (`Self [36]`) and one square (`Ginger [37]`), matching `Ginger(pets).databook.md`'s own one member (graph-36) and one tool graph (graph-37); its "Medical" box shows two circles (`Self [33]`, `Paula [57]`) and one square (`Ginger [32]`), matching `Medical.databook.md`'s two members (graph-33, graph-57) and one tool graph (graph-32). Run:

```python
import re, glob, yaml

def frontmatter(path):
    text = open(path, encoding='utf-8').read()
    m = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', text, re.DOTALL)
    return yaml.safe_load(m.group(1)) if m else None

def local_names(entries):
    entries = entries if isinstance(entries, list) else ([entries] if entries else [])
    return [e['id'].rsplit('/', 1)[-1] for e in entries]

for path in sorted(glob.glob('example/Pods/**/*.databook.md', recursive=True)):
    if 'under-development' in path.split('/'):
        continue
    fm = frontmatter(path)
    if not fm or fm.get('type') != 'pod-databook':
        continue
    tpod = fm.get('tpod', {}) or {}
    members = local_names(tpod.get('member'))
    tools = tpod.get('tool') or []
    tool_graphs = []
    for tool in (tools if isinstance(tools, list) else [tools]):
        tool_graphs += local_names(tool.get('graph'))
    print(f"{fm.get('title')!r:30} member(circle)={members}  tool(square)={tool_graphs}")
```

- **PNG-1d — Numbered graph circles/squares have matching embedded graphs**: Every numbered graph circle or square (e.g. `[10]`, `[17]`) shown in a diagram must correspond to a `tpod.member` entry or a tool's own graph (equivalently, a `### Graph NN` body section) in some pod-databook under `example/Pods/` whose id contains that number (e.g. `(10)`, `(17)`).

- **PNG-1e — Child arrows match folder nesting**: Every downward child arrow from pod box A to pod box B in a diagram must correspond to B's folder being a direct filesystem subfolder of A's folder (i.e. B is a descendant pod of A) — child links are derived purely from folder nesting, not any `child:` YAML field. Conversely, every direct-subfolder relationship between two pods must be reflected by a visible child arrow in the diagram.

- **PNG-1f — Black parenthetical category-label text matches `pod:category`'s concept label**: As the second line of a pod box's content (there is no blue Subject text above it any more — pod diagrams don't render a pod's subject at all, since it's derivable from the graph circles already drawn rather than an independently stored fact; see README's Representative Pods section), a pod box may carry a black parenthetical giving its `pod:category` concept's `skos:prefLabel` (from `pod-categories.ttl`) in human-readable form. It follows the exact same compression rule as the [Filename Convention](pod-databook.md#filename-convention)'s `<local>(<catType>)` filename form: shown only when that label differs from the box's own folder-name label, and omitted entirely when the two are identical. This text must match the co-located pod-databook's actual `tpod.category` concept's `skos:prefLabel`, verbatim — no more and no fewer words, never invented or abbreviated further. This is a visual check (no script) — e.g. `companies.png`'s "Google" and "ATT" boxes both show `(Companies)`, matching their shared `tpod.category: "podcat:Companies"` (label "Companies"); `gov-state.png`'s "Birth Certificate" and "Drivers License" boxes show no parenthetical at all, correctly compressed since each folder was renamed to match `podcat:BirthCertificate`'s/`podcat:DriversLicense`'s own label exactly; `gov-federal.png`'s "SSN" and "Passport" boxes are the same way, compressed against `podcat:SSN`'s/`podcat:Passport`'s own labels; `home.png`'s "Boston" and "Paradise" boxes both show `(Home)`, matching their shared `tpod.category: "podcat:Home"` (label "Home") — Boston reuses `podcat:Home` directly rather than the "Previous" scaffold's own `podcat:Previous`, since a previous residence is still just a Home category-wise, the current/previous distinction being a temporal fact on the address data itself, not a separate category; `things.png`'s "Things" box shows no parenthetical at all, correctly compressed since `podcat:Things`'s label already equals the folder name "Things"; `things.png`'s "RAV4" box shows `(Vehicles)`, matching `podcat:Vehicles`'s label; `travel.png`'s "Trips" box shows no parenthetical, correctly compressed since `podcat:Trips`'s label already equals the folder name "Trips", and its "Kyoto Trip 2027" box shows `(Trips)`, matching `podcat:Trips`'s label (reused from its immediate parent, the same "child folder reuses its parent's category" pattern RAV4/Ginger already use).

- **PNG-1g — Black curly-brace `{NN}` label matches the pod's own `pod-<NN>` id**: As the last line of a pod box's content (immediately below the Category text, or combined with it on one line, e.g. `(SSN) {6}`), a pod box carries a small black `{NN}` label in curly braces — the pod's own number. **Every** pod box carries one, scaffold pods (`Work`/`Acme`/`Employees`/`Vehicles`/`Travel`/`Trips`/`Companies`/`Finances`/`Home`/`Previous`/`State`/`Federal`/`People`/`Others`/`Pets`/`Groups` and the like) included, alongside its Category text where that isn't compressed away (PNG-1f). What a scaffold pod's box omits is only its **graph shapes**: every one of these pods carries real (stub) `member` content, and most carry a deliberately-empty tool graph as well, but neither is drawn as a circle or square — a visual simplification, not a sign the pod lacks content. This is the **only** thing such a pod is excused from, and it is scoped to the drawing: those graphs still get a PNG of their own (FS-2), a row in `example.md`'s Graphs section (FS-3), and everything else every other graph gets. Nothing is exempt from documentation for being undrawn (PNG-2). PNG-1c's shape-count rule is therefore scoped to pod boxes that draw graph shapes at all: a scaffold pod's box drawing none is conformant no matter how many `tpod.member` or tool-graph entries its pod-databook actually holds. Wherever `{NN}` appears, it must equal the zero-padded two-digit `<NN>` from the co-located pod-databook's own `id: http://www.example.org/tpod/pods/pod-<NN>` (see YAML-3). Don't confuse this with the numbered graph circles' `[NN]` labels (PNG-1d) — those are graph numbers in square brackets attached to a circle; this is the pod's own number in curly braces attached to the box itself. This is a visual check (no automated OCR), but the script below prints every folder's actual `pod-<NN>` for quick cross-reference against whichever diagram is being checked — e.g. `people.png`'s "Bob Johnson" box shows `{16}` and its "Fred Flintstone" box shows `{17}`; `people2.png`'s "Sophia Walker" (Immediate Family) box shows `{12}`, "Health & Wellness" shows `{13}`, "Jane Starostina" shows `{14}`, and "Medical Appointment" shows `{15}`; `companies.png`'s "Google"/"ATT" boxes show `{3}`/`{2}`; `finances.png`'s "Citibank" box shows `{4}`; `gov-state.png`'s "Government"/"State" boxes show `{25}`/`{28}`, and its "Birth Certificate"/"Drivers License" boxes show `{10}`/`{9}`; `gov-federal.png`'s "Government"/"Federal" boxes show `{25}`/`{26}`, and its "SSN"/"Passport" boxes show `{6}`/`{5}`; `home.png`'s "Home"/"Previous" boxes show `{48}`/`{49}`, and its "Boston"/"Paradise" boxes show `{7}`/`{8}`; `things.png`'s "Things" box shows `{11}`; `groups.png`'s "Boston Hub Society" box shows `{1}` and its "Chestnut Hill Village Association" box shows `{27}`; `work.png`'s "Paula"/"Alice Walker" boxes show `{19}`/`{18}`; `pets.png`'s "Ginger" box shows `{41}`, its "Medical" box shows `{40}`, and its "Care & Feeding" box shows `{42}`; `things.png`'s "RAV4" box shows `{44}`; `travel.png`'s "Kyoto Trip 2027" box shows `{47}`. Run:

```python
import glob, re

for path in sorted(glob.glob('example/Pods/**/*.databook.md', recursive=True)):
    if 'under-development' in path.split('/'):
        continue
    text = open(path).read()
    m = re.search(r'^id:\s*http://www\.example\.org/tpod/pods/(pod-\d{2})', text, re.MULTILINE)
    if m:
        print(f'{m.group(1)}  {path}')
```

- **PNG-1h — Fill color and folder-name-text color match real data**: Every pod across all 12 diagrams carries exactly two independent, mechanically-checkable colors, matching the legend's own "Category" box — the three fill swatches Person/Organization/None (see PNG-8 for the full four-box legend, and its identical rule for `representative-pods.png`): a **fill** color, applied to whatever box represents the pod — a plain pod box in these twelve diagrams, and the folder icon itself in `folder-mapping.png`, which draws no pod box of its own (see PNG-9). None of these twelve draws a Pod DataBook box, the DataBook being development scaffolding rather than part of the model; `folder-mapping.png` does draw one, being a picture of the scaffolding tree itself — tan if the folder's `tpod.category` resolves to `podcat:Person`, light blue if `podcat:Organization`, purple/Custom if the pod has no category at all — and a folder-**name-text** color (green/"Predefined" if the folder's `title:` equals the category concept's own `skos:prefLabel` verbatim, plain black/"User-defined" otherwise — always black for a no-category/Custom pod). This is a visual check (no automated pixel/OCR comparison) — use PNG-9's script (identical rule, just applied to a different set of diagrams) to compute the correct fill/text color for every real folder and cross-reference against whichever diagram is being checked — e.g. `people.png`: "People"/"Others" tan fill + green text; "Bob Johnson"/"Fred Flintstone" tan fill + black text; `work.png`: "Paula"/"Alice Walker" light-blue fill + black text; `people2.png`: "Sophia Walker"/"Jane Starostina" tan fill + black text; "Medical Appointment" tan fill + green text (folder name "Medical Appointment" now matches category `podcat:MedicalAppointment`'s own label verbatim); `pets.png`: "Pets"/"Medical"/"Care & Feeding" tan fill + green text (folder name matches category label in each case), "Ginger" tan fill + black text (category `podcat:Pets` label "Pets" ≠ folder name "Ginger"); `things.png`: "Vehicles" tan fill + green text (folder name matches category label), "RAV4" tan fill + black text (category `podcat:Vehicles` label "Vehicles" ≠ folder name "RAV4"); `travel.png`: "Travel"/"Trips" tan fill + green text (folder name matches category label in each case), "Kyoto Trip 2027" tan fill + black text (category `podcat:Trips` label "Trips" ≠ folder name "Kyoto Trip 2027"). No real example pod currently uses the Custom (no-category, `(custom)` filename) case — every current pod has a category — so no example diagram box is expected to show purple fill yet.

The 12 diagrams are: `example/images/people.png`, `example/images/people2.png`, `example/images/work.png`, `example/images/companies.png`, `example/images/finances.png`, `example/images/gov-state.png`, `example/images/gov-federal.png`, `example/images/home.png`, `example/images/things.png`, `example/images/groups.png`, `example/images/pets.png`, `example/images/travel.png`. There is no `health.png` — its content, e.g. Health & Wellness/Medical/Provider, lives in `people2.png` instead. `companies.png` shows the "Companies" scaffold pod (pod-15) and its three child content boxes "Google" (pod-03, `{3}`, graphs `[16]`/`[73]`), "ATT" (pod-02, `{2}`, graphs `[11]`/`[74]`) and "Arca" (pod-50, `{50}`, graphs `[95]`/`[96]`/`[97]`) — "Arca" is Alice's pod backup provider and the first worked example of a `service:ArcaBackup` pod member, its two circles being Alice (`[95]`) and the backup service itself (`[96]`, green/Other, claimed by `:Arca_Backup` — an agent service, carrying `s:actsFor :Self` alongside its `s:providedBy :Arca`). `pets.png` shows the "Ginger" pod (pod-41, `{41}`, graphs `[36]`/`[37]`) and its two sibling child pods "Medical" (pod-40, `{40}`, graphs `[32]`/`[33]`/`[57]`) and "Care & Feeding" (pod-42, `{42}`, graphs `[58]`/`[59]`/`[60]`) as content boxes under the `Pets → Ginger → {Medical, Care & Feeding}` folder nesting — "Medical" holds Ginger's medication content directly (no more nested "Medications" sub-pod, folded away when `podcat:PetsMedications` was merged into `podcat:PetsMedical`), and "Care & Feeding" is its new sibling for Ginger's day-to-day care instructions (`podcat:PetsCareAndFeeding`). `things.png` shows the "Things" pod (pod-11, `{11}`, graph `[22]`) and its child scaffold box "Vehicles" (no rendered content, per the bare-scaffold-pod treatment above) — "Vehicles"'s own child pod, "RAV4" (pod-44, `{44}`, graphs `[62]`/`[63]`), is drawn as a content box in this same diagram, one level further down (`Things → Vehicles → RAV4`). `travel.png` shows two bare scaffold boxes, "Travel" (pod-45) and its child "Trips" (pod-46), neither rendered with content (per the bare-scaffold-pod treatment above) — "Trips"'s own child pod, "Kyoto Trip 2027" (pod-47, `{47}`, graphs `[66]`/`[67]`/`[68]`/`[69]`/`[70]`/`[91]`), is drawn as a content box one level further down (`Travel → Trips → Kyoto Trip 2027`), with three member circles ("Self" `[66]`, "Agent" `[67]`, "Dave" `[68]`) and three tool-graph squares sharing one subject ("Kyoto" `[69]`/`[70]`/`[91]`, claimed by Self/Agent/Dave respectively) — the first worked example of an `s:AgentService` pod member (see README.md's [Service Ontology](README.md#service-ontology)) and, with one tool graph per member, the first worked example reaching `pod:formGraph`'s real upper bound (YAML-8).

**PNG-2 — Diagram ↔ files ↔ example.md coverage**: Every numbered graph circle in any of the 12 pod diagrams (`example/images/`) must have (a) a corresponding embedded graph section — a `tpod.member` or `tpod.tool[].graph` entry plus its `### Graph NN` body section — inside a pod-databook file under `example/Pods/`, and (b) a row in one of the tables in the **Graphs** section of `example.md`. Conversely, every row in those tables must correspond to an embedded graph that actually exists — and to that alone: a row does **not** need a numbered circle in any diagram. The 12 diagrams are not required to draw every graph, and deliberately do not: a purely organizational scaffold pod's box draws no graph shapes at all (PNG-1g), a visual simplification that keeps the diagrams uncluttered. Those pods' graphs are documented like any other — a row in `example.md`'s **Graphs** section and a PNG in `example/graphs/images/` (FS-2 and FS-3) — they are simply not drawn. If a circle exists in a diagram but has no embedded graph or `example.md` row, create them to match the diagram.

**PNG-3 — `pod.ttl` matches `images/pod-ontology/pod.png`**: `Pod` shows only `category` (to a `skos:Concept` box, drawn **0..1**, matching `pod:category`'s actual cardinality). `pod:category`'s range is the classificatory `skos:Concept` (scoped to `podcat:PodCategoryScheme`, pod-categories.ttl) — there is no tree-position class for it to be confused with, so it does not conflict with `pod:Pod`'s "no link to a tree position" design (see `pod:Pod`'s own `rdfs:comment`) — it records what kind of thing a pod is, not where it lives, and needs no `owl:imports pod-categories.ttl` (referenced by name only, mirroring `pod:creator`'s identical pattern). The diagram shows three arrows off `Pod` with no counterpart in `pod.ttl` — `note` (to a placeholder box, `(markdown file) 1..1`), `attachment` (to a placeholder box, `(file) 0..N` — the files every member of the pod receives, not every file loose in the pod's own folder, which are the member's own private ones), and `chat` (to a placeholder box, `(a chat stream) 1..1` — every pod always has a chat stream, possibly empty, held inside the app rather than in the pod's folder) — this is a deliberate, accepted exception to 12a/12b below: README.md already describes all three properties' intended semantics (see the Documentation-only Properties section) as planned, but `pod.ttl` itself has no `pod:note`/`pod:attachment`/`pod:chat` declaration yet — none of the three is ever reified as a triple in any real graph. `Pod` (abstract, blue) carries `category` only (plus the still-open `note`/`attachment`/`chat` arrows above). `Pod` splits into two disjoint kinds (`owl:disjointWith` — a pod is always exactly one, never both): `TemplatePod` (abstract, blue, a reusable class-level template) carries `memberShape` (to a `sh:NodeShape` box, 0..N) and `declaresTool` (to a `pod:Tool` box, 0..N) — `category`, drawn off the shared `Pod` box above, applies to `TemplatePod` too (every real template carries one, naming the concept it's a template for); `InstancePod` (concrete, black, an actual pod instantiated in a user's own tree) carries `member` (to a `pod:MemberGraph` box, 1..N, no fixed upper bound), `tool` (to a `pod:Tool` box, 0..N), `creator` (to a `p:Person` box, 1..1), `owner` (to its own `p:Person` box, 1..N, no fixed upper bound — every arrow in this diagram carries its own target label, so `creator` and `owner` are drawn as two separate `p:Person` boxes rather than sharing one), and the two tag properties `userTag` (to an `xsd:string` box) and `serviceTag` (to a `pod:ServiceTag` box), each 0..N, no fixed upper bound — `pod.ttl`'s Pod Tags section. The two tag arrows hang off `InstancePod`, never off `Pod`: their domain is `pod:InstancePod` deliberately, since a `TemplatePod` seeds no tags — this is the opposite placement from `category`, which is drawn off the shared `Pod` box precisely because a template does carry one. The two point at different kinds of target because they are different shapes: a user tag is a bare literal, while a service tag is a value node. `ServiceTag` and the `Tool` hierarchy are **not** drawn in this diagram: each has its own, `images/pod-ontology/tag.png` (PNG-6) and `images/pod-ontology/tool.png` (PNG-7). Here they appear only as arrow targets — a `pod:ServiceTag` box off `serviceTag`, and a `pod:Tool` box off both `tool` and `declaresTool` — never as members of the `Pod` hierarchy, which neither has an `rdfs:subClassOf` relation to. There is no `shape` arrow off `InstancePod` at all — a pod stores no shape of its own; the `shape` property that does exist has domain `pod:Graph` and is drawn in `graph.png` (PNG-4) (an `InstancePod`'s validation shape is derived via a reverse lookup on its own `category` value rather than stored) — and no pod-level `subject` arrow off `InstancePod` either — there is no such property (a pod's own subject is derived from its tools' own `pod:formTopic` values, or failing those from `member`'s own `pod:subject` values, rather than stored on the pod itself; those two are real, surviving properties, scoped to `pod:Tool` and `pod:MemberGraph` rather than to `InstancePod` — see PNG-4). `TemplatePod` has no subclasses of its own, and no individual is ever typed both `TemplatePod` and `InstancePod` — every template individual in `pod-category-templates.ttl` is typed solely `TemplatePod`. No arrow points from `Pod`, `TemplatePod`, or `InstancePod` to any tree-position box at all — `pod:category`'s arrow points to `skos:Concept` instead, the classificatory hierarchy. This diagram is the ontology-level (not example-tree) picture of `pod:Pod`'s structure — the member-composition hierarchy and its content-linking properties. A single "Key" box in the lower right carries three swatches, in this order — blue "Abstract", black "Concrete and visible", green "Concrete but hidden" — and the class-box colors track them exactly: blue is `pod:abstract true` in `pod.ttl` (`Pod` and `TemplatePod`, and nothing else here) and black is every remaining concrete class. The Key lists exactly the swatches this diagram actually uses — two here, since the one green ("concrete but hidden") class, `ServiceTag`, is drawn in `tag.png` instead. A concrete class may only be green where `pod.ttl` or `README.md` actually says the user never sees it; absent that, it is black. Unlike PNG-1 (example diagrams, where the diagram always wins), this check does not presume which side is authoritative when the two disagree — surface the discrepancy and ask:

- **12a** — every property arrow shown off `Pod` (`category`) has a corresponding `pod:` property in `pod.ttl` with `rdfs:domain pod:Pod` (the diagram's `note`, `attachment`, and `chat` arrows are the three accepted exceptions — see above: all three are planned properties, not yet added to `pod.ttl`). Every arrow off `TemplatePod` (`memberShape`, `declaresTool`) has `rdfs:domain pod:TemplatePod`, and every arrow off `InstancePod` (`creator`, `owner`, `member`, `tool`, `userTag`, `serviceTag`) has `rdfs:domain pod:InstancePod`. No arrow may appear off the `pod:Tool` or `pod:ServiceTag` target boxes here — those belong to PNG-7 and PNG-6. No `shape` arrow should appear off `InstancePod` at all — a pod stores no shape of its own, and `pod:shape`'s domain is `pod:Graph`, so it belongs in `graph.png` (PNG-4) (an `InstancePod`'s validation shape is derived via `category`, never stored). No pod-level `subject` arrow should appear off `InstancePod` either — that property doesn't exist (see PNG-3's own note above); `pod:subject` is real, but scoped to `pod:MemberGraph`, not to `InstancePod` (see PNG-4). Each arrow's target type in the diagram must match the property's `rdfs:range` — `member`'s is `pod:MemberGraph` and `formGraph`'s is `pod:FormGraph` — deliberately *different* classes, one per list, `tool`'s and `declaresTool`'s are both `pod:Tool`, `creator`'s and `owner`'s are both `p:Person` (two separate arrows, each with its own target box — what must match is the range, not the box count), `userTag`'s is `xsd:string` and `serviceTag`'s is `pod:ServiceTag` (two separate arrows, each 0..N — not one shared arrow, since a tag's kind is carried entirely by which property holds it, and the two no longer even share a target), `tagNamespace`'s, `tagKey`'s and `tagValue`'s are all `xsd:string` (three separate arrows, each 1..1), `category`'s is `skos:Concept` itself (value is a named category-concept individual, scoped via `skos:inScheme podcat:PodCategoryScheme` — no class-value punning, since pod-categories.ttl's tree is SKOS, not OWL classes), `memberShape`'s is `sh:NodeShape` (0..N, not 0..1). `formShape` does **not** appear in this diagram at all — its domain is `pod:Tool`, so it is drawn in `tool.png` (PNG-7).
- **12b** — every `pod:` property defined in `pod.ttl` appears as an arrow in the diagram, under the box matching its domain — `Pod`, `TemplatePod`, `InstancePod`, `Tool` (or one of its `Form`/`Calendar`/`Canvas` subclasses), or `ServiceTag` (catches new properties added to the ttl but never drawn, or drawn under the wrong box).
- **12c** — the class hierarchy `Pod` → `TemplatePod`/`InstancePod` (both `owl:disjointWith` one another) shown in the diagram matches `pod.ttl`'s actual `rdfs:subClassOf` relationships (by class local name, not just position). No class hangs below `InstancePod`: a pod that carries a tool is not a different kind of pod, only one carrying `tool` values. `pod:Tool` takes no part in this hierarchy — it has no `rdfs:subClassOf` relation to `Pod` or to either of its kinds, so no subclass line may connect the two; an `InstancePod` *points at* tools via `pod:tool`, and a `TemplatePod` at declared ones via `pod:declaresTool`, but neither contains them as subclasses. `ServiceTag` likewise takes no part in this hierarchy: it is a value-node class `pod:serviceTag` points at, with no `rdfs:subClassOf` in `pod.ttl`, so no subclass line may connect it to `Pod` or to any of `Pod`'s kinds, and its green fill is a display fact about its instances rather than anything `pod:abstract` records.

**PNG-4 — `pod.ttl`'s graph-DataBook classes match `images/pod-ontology/graph.png`**: `pod:Graph`/`pod:CGraph`/`pod:MemberGraph`/`pod:FormGraph` and their `shape`/`claimant`/`subject` annotation properties — the graph-DataBook classification vocabulary, defined in `pod.ttl` since a graph DataBook only ever exists to be linked from a pod — are diagrammed separately from `pod.ttl`'s member-composition hierarchy (PNG-3's `pod.png`), in this dedicated `graph.png`. The diagram shows four boxes on three levels: `Graph` at the top, `CGraph` beneath it, and `CGraph`'s two leaves `MemberGraph` and `FormGraph` side by side. `Graph` shows only `shape` (targeting `sh:NodeShape` 0..N, matching `pod:shape`'s actual `rdfs:range`); `CGraph` (subClassOf `Graph`) shows only `claimant` (targeting `p:Person`/`o:Organization`/`s:Service` 1..1); `MemberGraph` (subClassOf `CGraph`) shows only `subject` (targeting `xsd:anyURI` 1..1), while `FormGraph` (subClassOf `CGraph`) shows no property arrow at all — its about-ness is the holding tool's own `formTopic`, drawn in `pod.png`. No `subject`, `about-by` or `topic` arrow appears anywhere — the two about-ness properties are spelled `subject` (on `pod:MemberGraph`) and `formTopic` (on `pod:Tool`) in `pod.ttl`, so a diagram edge labeled with the bare short form is stale and should be relabeled. No leaf subtype boxes appear below `MemberGraph` or `FormGraph` — neither has subclasses. A "Key" box in the lower right carries two swatches, in this order — blue "Abstract", black "Concrete and visible" — and the class-label colors track them exactly: blue is `pod:abstract true` in `pod.ttl` (`Graph` and `CGraph`), black is every concrete class (`MemberGraph`, `FormGraph`). This is the same convention `pod.png` uses (PNG-3), minus its green "Concrete but hidden" swatch, which is correctly absent here since no class in this diagram is one the app hides from the user. This diagram is the ontology-level picture of `pod:Graph`'s structure.

The split into two leaves is the diagram's substantive claim, and it is a PDN-layer one: a `claimant` and a `subject` value always name a party holding a PDN node subject identity, whereas the `formTopic` standing above a `FormGraph` need not and routinely does not (a `pets:Pet`, a `vehicles:Vehicle`, an `identitydocuments:Passport`, a recipe, a poem). That is why the two are separate properties on separate `owl:disjointWith` classes rather than one property with a wider range. After any change to `pod.ttl`'s graph-DataBook terms or to this diagram, verify:

- **13a** — every property arrow shown off `Graph` in the diagram (`shape`) has a corresponding `pod:` property in `pod.ttl` with `rdfs:domain pod:Graph`, and its target type matches the property's `rdfs:range`.
- **13b** — the one arrow off `CGraph` (`claimant`) has `rdfs:domain pod:CGraph`, not `pod:MemberGraph`; its target in the diagram must match its actual `rdfs:range` — a union of `p:Person`/`o:Organization`/`service:Service`. No `about-by` arrow should appear — `pod.ttl` defines no such property.
- **13c** — the one arrow off `MemberGraph` (`subject`) has `rdfs:domain pod:MemberGraph`, and its target must match its actual `rdfs:range`, any resource IRI (`xsd:anyURI`), not a Person/Organization union. `FormGraph` carries **no** about-ness arrow of its own: what a tool's graphs are about is the holding tool's single `formTopic`, drawn in `pod.png` (PNG-3) rather than here. Neither leaf may show the other's arrow — the two are `owl:disjointWith`, and `shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:FormGraphShape` carries an `sh:maxCount 0` on `pod:subject` to enforce it.
- **13d** — every `pod:` property whose domain is one of these four classes, defined in `pod.ttl`, appears in the diagram under the correct box (catches new properties added to the ttl but never drawn, or drawn under the wrong box).
- **13e** — the hierarchy `Graph` → `CGraph` → `MemberGraph`/`FormGraph` shown in the diagram matches `pod.ttl`'s actual `rdfs:subClassOf` relationships by class local name, and the two leaves carry `owl:disjointWith` one another. `Graph` and `CGraph` are both `pod:abstract true`; the two leaves are not.
- **13f** — the class-label colors match `pod.ttl`'s `pod:abstract` annotations: `Graph` and `CGraph` blue (both `pod:abstract true`), `MemberGraph` and `FormGraph` black (neither carries it). The Key box lists exactly the swatches the diagram actually uses — two here, since nothing in this diagram is hidden from the user; do not paste `pod.png`'s third, green swatch in unless a hidden class is ever added.
- **13g** — no subclasses appear below `MemberGraph` or `FormGraph` — `pod.ttl` defines none for either. If any appear here or in `pod.ttl`, reconcile them. Check also that `pod:member`'s `rdfs:range` is `pod:MemberGraph` and `pod:formGraph`'s is `pod:FormGraph` (the ranges are what type a real graph, since nothing in a `tpod.member` entry or a tool's own graph marks its own kind — see YAML-2).

**PNG-5 — `pod-categories.ttl` matches `images/pod-categories/pod-categories.png`**: This diagram is the picture of `pod-categories.ttl`'s SKOS concept scheme, not an OWL class hierarchy: `podcat:PodCategoryScheme` (a `skos:ConceptScheme` box) carries `hasTopConcept` arrows to `podcat:Person`/`podcat:Organization`, each a plain `skos:Concept` box (there is no `podcat:Category` class anywhere in the diagram — every box is an individual, not a class), each with representative narrower-concept examples reachable via `broader` arrows drawn concept → concept (Groups/People/Work → Person; Suppliers/People (org) → Organization). There is no `templatePod` arrow anywhere — that property was removed; a templated concept's reusable content is found from `pod-category-templates.ttl`'s side instead (see PNG-3), not drawn on this diagram at all. No `Folder`/`CategoryDefined`/`UserDefined` boxes and no `child`/`pod`/`category`/`catType`/`label` arrows should appear anywhere. This diagram does not presume which side is authoritative when the two disagree — surface the discrepancy and ask. After any change to `pod-categories.ttl` or to this diagram, verify:

- **14a** — the only property arrows in the diagram are `hasTopConcept` (off `PodCategoryScheme`, to `Person`/`Organization`) and `broader` (off every other concept, to its own parent concept) — matching `pod-categories.ttl`'s actual `skos:hasTopConcept`/`skos:broader` triples — **plus the category-extension inset described in 14d**, which is the one part of this diagram not drawn from `pod-categories.ttl`. No `templatePod` arrow should appear anywhere — that property no longer exists in `pod-categories.ttl` at all. No `catType`, `child`, `pod`, `category`, `label`, or `narrower` arrow should appear anywhere either — `pod-categories.ttl` asserts only `broader` (child → parent), never the inverse `narrower`, and defines none of the `Folder`/`CategoryDefined`/`UserDefined` classes such arrows would live on. No `memberShape`/`formShape` arrow should appear either — those are `pod.ttl` properties (see PNG-3), never `pod-categories.ttl` ones. There must be no `Canonical` box and no `copiedFrom` arrow anywhere — `pod-categories.ttl` defines neither.
- **14b** — every `skos:` property actually asserted in `pod-categories.ttl` (`hasTopConcept`, `broader`, `inScheme`, `topConceptOf`, `prefLabel`) appears as an arrow or label in the diagram, under the box matching its domain (catches a new relationship added to the ttl but never drawn). `pod-categories.ttl` defines no `podcat:` property of its own any more.
- **14c** — the concept structure shown in the diagram — `PodCategoryScheme` → `hasTopConcept` → `Person`/`Organization` → `broader`-linked narrower concepts — matches `pod-categories.ttl`'s actual `skos:hasTopConcept`/`skos:broader` triples (by concept local name, not just position), the 14d inset excepted. There is no class hierarchy to check any more — `pod-categories.ttl` defines no `owl:Class` other than the ontology header's implicit `owl:Ontology` typing, and no `Folder` hierarchy at all.

- **14d — the category-extension inset** — the diagram carries exactly one illustration of the [category extension](README.md#category-extensions) mechanism, and it is the only content here that does not come from `pod-categories.ttl`. It is **two boxes and two arrows**: an `ExtensionScheme` box (a `skos:ConceptScheme`) and an `ExtensionConcept` box (a `skos:Concept`), joined by a green `hasTopConcept` arrow concept → scheme, plus a **dashed purple `broadMatch` arrow** from `ExtensionConcept` to one core concept (`Groups`). The dashed line is load-bearing: solid means hierarchy within one scheme, dashed means a mapping between schemes, which is the whole SKOS distinction the mechanism rests on (see TTL-8). The labels must stay **generic placeholders** — never a real publisher's concept such as `bhscat:BostonHubSociety` — since this diagram is embedded in `README.md`, which carries theory only; the worked extension belongs in `example.md`. The two boxes follow the Key's own color rule exactly as the core tree does: `ExtensionScheme` is **blue** (Abstract — a `skos:ConceptScheme` is never shown to a user, which is why `PodCategoryScheme` is blue too), and `ExtensionConcept` is **black** (Visible to user — it is the category a pod is actually filed under, the peer of `Groups`, which the `broadMatch` arrow points at). Getting these the same color as each other is the easy mistake: it makes a scheme and a concept read as one kind of thing. The Key carries a matching third arrow row, `broadMatch`, alongside `hasTopConcept` and `broader concept`. No other extension box, arrow, or scheme may appear: one inset is an illustration, several would be a second taxonomy.

**PNG-6 — `pod.ttl`'s `pod:ServiceTag` matches `images/pod-ontology/tag.png`**: The service-tag value node has its own diagram rather than sitting inside `pod.png`, since it takes no part in the `Pod` hierarchy at all. `ServiceTag` (concrete but hidden, green) is drawn as a standalone box carrying three arrows — `tagNamespace`, `tagKey` and `tagValue` — each to an `xsd:string` box at `1..1`:

- **37a** — each of the three arrows has `rdfs:domain pod:ServiceTag` and `rdfs:range xsd:string` in `pod.ttl`, and each is required exactly once (`shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:ServiceTagShape`, `sh:minCount 1`/`sh:maxCount 1`). No fourth arrow appears — `pod.ttl` defines no other property on this class.
- **37b** — `ServiceTag` is drawn green, the "concrete but hidden" swatch: it is concrete (no `pod:abstract` annotation in `pod.ttl`) and the app never displays its values to the user, nor matches them in the user's own tag search (see `pod:serviceTag`'s own comment). It carries no `rdfs:subClassOf`, so no subclass line may connect it to `Pod` or any of `Pod`'s kinds.
- **37c** — no `serviceTag` arrow is drawn *into* `ServiceTag` here; that arrow belongs to `InstancePod` in `pod.png` (PNG-3), which shows `pod:ServiceTag` only as a target box.

**PNG-7 — `pod.ttl`'s `pod:Tool` hierarchy matches `images/pod-ontology/tool.png`**: The tool hierarchy has its own diagram for the same reason `tag.png` does — `pod:Tool` has no `rdfs:subClassOf` relation to `pod:Pod`, so it is not part of that hierarchy and is only pointed at from it. `Tool` (abstract, blue) sits at the top with its five concrete children `Calendar`, `Canvas`, `Contacts`, `Map` and `Form` (all black) below it:

- **38a** — **no arrow is drawn off `Tool` at all.** `pod.ttl` defines no property with `rdfs:domain pod:Tool`: all three tool-content properties are scoped to `pod:Form`, the one tool class with a content model. An arrow drawn off the abstract class would assert of `Calendar`, `Canvas`, `Contacts` and `Map` something none of the four has a data format for yet.
- **38b** — all three arrows hang off `Form`, each with `rdfs:domain pod:Form`: `formTopic` to an `xsd:anyURI` box at **1..1** (required exactly once on a live form tool — `shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:LiveToolShape`, conditioned on the class), `formGraph` to a `pod:FormGraph` box at **1..N**, and `formShape` to a `sh:NodeShape` box at 0..N. OWL/SHACL sets no maximum on `formGraph` — the real upper bound, one graph per pod member each with a distinct claimant, is YAML-8, not something this diagram draws.
- **38c** — `Calendar`, `Canvas`, `Contacts` and `Map` carry no arrows: `pod.ttl` defines no property with any of them as its domain, and they inherit none, since `Tool` carries none either. All four are drawn all the same, so the extension point reads as plural rather than as a `Form` that happens to be abstract's only child.
- **38d** — the hierarchy `Tool` → `Calendar`/`Canvas`/`Map`/`Form` matches `pod.ttl`'s actual `rdfs:subClassOf` relationships by class local name. The four leaves are **not** `owl:disjointWith` one another (unlike `pod:MemberGraph`/`pod:FormGraph`, and unlike `pod:TemplatePod`/`pod:InstancePod`), so no disjointness is drawn between them.
- **38e** — the class-label colors match `pod.ttl`'s `pod:abstract` annotations: `Tool` blue (`pod:abstract true`), the four leaves black (none carries it). The Key lists exactly the swatches this diagram uses — two here, since nothing in it is the green "concrete but hidden" case.
- **38f** — no `tool` or `declaresTool` arrow is drawn *into* `Tool` here; both belong to `pod.png` (PNG-3), which shows `pod:Tool` only as a target box.

**PNG-8 — `images/representative-pods.png` matches example usage**: The legend is **five separate titled boxes**, stacked in this order — "Name", "Category", "Claimant", "Tool", "Members" — not the single "Key" box it once was, and it carries no "Pod" swatch at all (retired along with the member-count border styles, see README.md's Representative Pods section, which states the uniform-border rule). The identical five-box block appears in all 14 diagrams (the 12 example diagrams plus `images/representative-pods.png` and `images/folder-mapping.png`), so a change to it has to be applied fourteen times by hand — the same fan-out PNG-11 already warns about. Box by box: **Category** holds three fill-color swatches — Person (tan), Organization (light blue), None (purple/lavender), labeled just "None", not "None (Custom)". **Name** holds a compact two-line folder-name-text formula, "Category / User-" (green "Category", bold black "User-") / "defined + (Category)" (bold black) — green text means the folder's name is copied verbatim from its category's own `skos:prefLabel`, black means the user gave it a different name (shown alongside its `(Category)` parenthetical), and a Custom (no-category) folder's name is always black, never green, since it has no label to match. **Claimant** holds two claim-color swatches — a green-filled swatch labeled "Other" (claimed by someone other than the self) and a dashed/outlined swatch labeled "Self" (claimed by the user). Claim fill is a two-state fact and nothing more; there is no third "Delegate" fill (retired — an `s:AgentService`'s claims are green like any other non-self party's, and see PNG-10). **Tool** holds one shape swatch — a square labeled "Form" — naming the kind of tool a square stands for, so a second tool kind gaining a shape of its own has somewhere to go. **Members** holds two — a circle labeled "Human" and an octagon labeled "Service". Splitting the two apart is what keeps the shape convention legible: a square is a graph held by a tool, while a circle or octagon is a member entry, and the circle/octagon difference is a further fact about that member's own identity type. `images/folder-mapping.png` carries the full five-box block too, even though it draws no graph shapes or claim fills of its own and so exercises only the Category and Name boxes — the block is pasted identically rather than trimmed per diagram, which is deliberate and not a discrepancy to flag. **Shape**, not fill, is what distinguishes a `pod:member` graph from a tool's own graph, and among members it further distinguishes *who that member is*: a circle where the member's own `pod:subject` is a `p:Person`, an octagon where it is an `s:Service` of any kind (`s:ChatGPT`, `s:ArcaBackup`, or `s:ServiceProvider`). Fill/outline is layered on independently to show only who claimed that graph, so any of the three shapes can carry either fill — the two axes are orthogonal, and an octagon says nothing about who claimed it. The legend carries no "Pod" swatch at all any more: the member-count border-style distinction it once held (three separate "3+-Member Pod"/"2 Member Pod"/"1 Member Pod" entries, later collapsed to one uniform "Pod" swatch) was retired project-wide (see README.md's Representative Pods section, which states the uniform-border rule) — a pod's member count is no longer a visually-checkable fact anywhere in this diagram. None of the legend's names are OWL classes — `pod-categories.ttl` defines no `Folder`/`CategoryDefined`/`UserDefined` class; Custom stays a pure filename/display convention. Every circle/square carries an explicit subject-name label (e.g. "Bob", "Self", "BHS") baked directly into the shape — this is how a viewer still learns who is involved, without a separate Subject annotation. There is no "Subject" heading grouping these any more, and no blue per-box Subject text — a pod box no longer displays its subject at all, since it's derivable from the circles/squares already drawn rather than an independently stored fact (see README's Representative Pods section). This diagram illustrates representative pod/category associations — seven boxes, each with a single-line folder-name header (no separate `catType`/`label` split), fill color on the pod's own box (this diagram draws no separate folder icon at all, unlike `folder-mapping.png` — see PNG-9). Six of the seven are generic, not tied to a specific example instance; the seventh, `Kyoto Trip 2027`, is drawn from real `pod-47` data and is the only box illustrating an `s:Service` member (its "Chat-GPT" octagon):
  - `Medical Appointment` (tan/`Person` fill, green text — folder name matches category `(Medical Appointment)`'s own label exactly, two squares "Med. Appt mt." — one green/Other, one white/Self, both about the same subject, demonstrating that a single topic can be claimed more than once: a tool holds one graph per member asserting it, capped at the pod's own member count (YAML-8), reached here at two — plus two circles "Self" (white) and "Bob" (green); two members)
  - `Friends` (purple/Custom fill, black text, no category at all, shown as `()`, two circles: a white "Self" member — the pod's required `member` entry, per YAML-6 — and a green "Fred", since Fred is the derived subject but not a member; no squares; two members)
  - `Employee` (light-blue/`Organization` fill, green text — folder name matches category `(Employee)`'s own label exactly, one white "Self" circle, no squares; one member)
  - `Bob Johnson` (tan/`Person` fill, black text — category `(Others)` ≠ folder name, four circles — two white/Self, two green/Other, all four `pod:member` link types filled; no squares; two members)
  - `Boston Hub Society` (tan/`Person` fill, green text — the folder name matches its category `bhscat:BostonHubSociety`'s own `skos:prefLabel` exactly, so no category parenthetical is shown, correctly compressed the same way `People` is; the category is an extension concept (`pod-category-ext/boston-hub-society.ttl`) rather than one of `podcat:PodCategoryScheme`'s own, and the tan Person fill still applies because it reaches `podcat:Person` through its single `skos:broadMatch podcat:Groups`, two circles and one octagon (Self white circle, Bob green circle, and a green **octagon** for the third `pod:member`, whose `pod:subject` is `:BHS_Service`, an `s:ServiceProvider`, rather than `:BHS` itself — though its claim is still attributed to the organization, which is why the fill is green/Other) plus one green square (BHS's own organization profile, held by a form tool) — illustrative only, not tied to real pod-01 data (which carries no tool at all, see YAML-4); three or more members)
  - `People` (tan/`Person` fill, green text — no category parenthetical shown, correctly compressed since the category's label already equals the folder name, one white "Self" circle, no squares; one member)
  - `Kyoto Trip 2027` (tan/`Person` fill, black text — category `(Trips)` ≠ folder name; the one box drawn from real example data, `pod-47`. Two circles and one octagon — "Self" (white circle), "Dave" (green circle), and "Chat-GPT" (green **octagon**, since its `pod:subject` is Alice's invited `s:ChatGPT` rather than a `p:Person`; its green fill is the ordinary Other fill, the same one Dave's circle carries) — and three squares, all labeled "Kyoto" and all about the same subject `:Kyoto_Trip_2027`, one per claimant: white/Self (graph-69), green/Other (graph-70), green/Other (graph-91). This is the diagram's only worked example of a tool reaching its real upper bound of one graph per member, each with a distinct claimant — YAML-8; three members)

  Each pod box shows no icon of any kind — no folder icon and no separate "note", "attachment", or "chat" icon (see PNG-3's `pod:note`/`pod:attachment`/`pod:chat` planned-property note, which concerns `pod.png` only, not this diagram) — just the filled box itself. Re-verify each box's circles/squares remain a valid illustration of the properties and cardinalities described in the Pod and Graph Ontology sections of `README.md` after any change to those properties.

**PNG-9 — `images/folder-mapping.png` folder colors match real data**: This diagram has no dedicated check of its own until now (unlike `representative-pods.png`'s PNG-8). Every pod shown in this diagram (and in `representative-pods.png`, and in all 12 example diagrams — PNG-1h) carries exactly two independent, mechanically-checkable colors: a **fill** color, applied to whatever box represents the pod — in this diagram the folder icon itself, this being a picture of the repo's scaffolding tree rather than of a pod as the app holds it — which is also why it does draw a Pod DataBook box, unlike the 12 example diagrams — (tan if the pod's `tpod.category` resolves to `podcat:Person`, light blue if `podcat:Organization`, purple/Custom if the pod has no category at all) and a folder-**name-text** color (green/"Predefined" if the pod's `title:` equals the category concept's own `skos:prefLabel` verbatim, plain black/"User-defined" otherwise — and always black for a no-category/Custom pod, since there's no label to match). A pod with no category is identified by that absence alone; this repo's scaffolding mirrors it in the pod-databook's filename, which carries the literal `(custom)` disambiguator (see the [Filename Convention](pod-databook.md#filename-convention)). The two facts must always agree; either alone without the other is an error. That pairing is a scaffolding check — at runtime there is no filename to agree with. This is a visual check (no automated pixel/OCR comparison), but the script below computes the correct fill and text color for every real pod, for direct cross-reference against whichever diagram box is being checked — e.g. this diagram's "People" box (category `podcat:People`, folder name "People") and its "Others" box (category `podcat:Others`, folder name "Others") should each be tan fill + green text, while "Fred Flintstone" (category `podcat:Others`, folder name "Fred Flintstone") should be tan fill + black text — the user-defined-name case. Only a folder that is a pod carries fill at all: this diagram also draws `_pod-attachments` folders and a private-content folder, which stay white, and its key names that distinction, the tan/white split being exactly the pod/not-a-pod test the marker decides. The diagram currently carries no no-category pod, so the purple/Custom fill has no instance in it; its Category legend accordingly lists **Person** alone. That is the rule for this diagram's legend generally, matching PNG-3's for `pod.png`: the Key lists exactly the swatches the drawing actually uses, so a swatch whose case is not drawn comes out rather than standing as an unexercised entry. Run:

```python
import glob, re, yaml

**PNG-10 — a graph shape's claim-fill color matches its graph's own `claimant`**: PNG-1c settles a pod box's graph *shapes* (a circle per `member` entry, a square per tool graph) and explicitly defers their **fill** to PNG-8's legend, as "a separate, independent fact showing who claimed that graph". PNG-1h then checks only the *pod box*'s own Person/Organization/Custom fill and its folder-name-text color. So the claim-fill of the circles and squares themselves — the one color that encodes `pod:claimant` — was defined but verified nowhere, in any of the 12 diagrams. This check closes that gap. The rule, per PNG-8's legend, is a three-way partition of every drawn graph shape, decided entirely by that graph's own `claimant`:

- **outlined/unfilled (Self)** — `claimant: ":Self"`.
- **green (Other)** — every other claimant: another `p:Person`, an `o:Organization`, or any `service:Service`, whether it is an `s:AgentService` leaf or an `s:ServiceProvider`, and whether the graph is a `member` or a tool graph.

Claim fill is therefore a two-state fact — self or not-self — and nothing more. There is no third "Delegate" fill: an AI agent's claims are green like any other non-self party's, and *who* a member is (human vs. service) is carried by the member shape instead, not by its color. That keeps the two facts orthogonal, so a shape's fill can be read without knowing anything about its claimant's type.

The palette values are exact, so this is mechanically checkable by sampling the PNGs directly rather than by eye. Only the two *filled* states can be counted — an unfilled Self shape is the same white as the page background — but that is enough for any single miscolor, since it always moves a shape between buckets and so changes a filled count. The one blind spot is a pair of offsetting errors inside the same branch — one shape wrongly unfilled and another wrongly filled the same color — which leaves the totals intact; the counts are small enough that such a pair is worth a glance at the diagram when a branch is edited. (This is exactly how `companies.png`'s `Arca` `[96]` circle was caught: claimed by `:Arca_Backup`, it was drawn unfilled, leaving `companies.png` with 0 green shapes where the data calls for 1.) Legend swatches are excluded by area — a real circle or square is ~96×96px, a swatch far smaller. Each diagram is matched to its pods by top-level branch; `people.png` and `people2.png` split one branch between them, so they are summed and compared jointly. Requires `pip install pillow`. Run:

```

If a violation is found, the diagram is the authoritative side for *which pods and shapes exist* (PNG-1), but the DataBook is authoritative for *who claimed a graph* — a `claimant` is a fact about the data, not a drawing choice. So recolor the shape to match its graph's own `claimant` under the three-way rule above. A count that is short by one green usually means a non-`:Self`-claimed shape was left unfilled; a count long by one usually means a `:Self`-claimed shape was filled. The check reports counts rather than naming the offending shape, since matching a specific circle to a specific graph number would require reading the diagram's own `[NN]` labels; with per-diagram counts the candidates are few enough to spot by eye.

**PNG-11 — no diagram still carries the retired "Delegate" legend swatch**: The 12 example diagrams plus `images/representative-pods.png` each carry their own copy of the legend, so a change to it has to be applied thirteen times by hand. (`images/folder-mapping.png` is also scanned below, but carries a key of its own — two folder swatches plus a `Folder name: Category / User-defined` line — rather than this legend.) That legend is now five separate titled boxes — "Name", "Category", "Claimant", "Tool", "Members" — rather than the single "Key" box it once was (see PNG-8 for the full box-by-box contents); the ones that matter here are **Claimant**, holding two claim-fill swatches (green "Other", dashed "Self"), **Tool**, holding one shape swatch (square "Form"), and **Members**, holding two (circle "Human", octagon "Service"); it no longer holds the gray "Delegate" swatch that a third claim-fill state once needed (see PNG-8 and PNG-10 — claim fill is now a two-state self/not-self fact, and a member's identity type is carried by shape instead). A diagram left on the older key is mechanically detectable, because that swatch is the only place a filled `(235, 235, 235)` block of any size appears: the new key uses no gray at all, and the incidental gray in these PNGs is antialiasing a few dozen pixels in size, far below the threshold below. This catches the stale-legend case that PNG-10 cannot — PNG-10 compares fills against the DataBooks and so passes happily on a diagram whose *shapes* are all correct but whose *legend* still advertises a retired state. Requires `pip install pillow`. Run:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

GRAY = (235, 235, 235)      # the retired "Delegate" swatch fill
MIN_AREA = 200              # far above antialiasing, far below a real swatch (~1150px)

    for x in range(W):
        for y in range(H):
            if seen[x][y] or px[x, y] != GRAY:

                        stack.append((m, n))
            if area >= MIN_AREA:
                found.append((area, min(xs), min(ys), max(xs) - min(xs) + 1, max(ys) - min(ys) + 1))
    return found

violations = 0
for path in KEYED:
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        violations += 1
        print(f'VIOLATION {path}: keyed diagram missing from disk')
        continue
    blocks = gray_blocks(path)
    if blocks:
        violations += 1
        where = ', '.join(f'{a}px {w}x{h} at ({x},{y})' for a, x, y, w, h in blocks)
        print(f'VIOLATION {path}: gray {GRAY} region(s) present — {where}')
print('No diagram carries the retired Delegate swatch.' if violations == 0
      else f'{violations} violation(s) found.')
```

If a violation is found, the diagram is still on an older legend and needs it replaced with the current five-box block (PNG-8): drop the gray "Delegate" swatch, and make sure the square swatch sits in its own "Tool" box labeled "Form" while the "Members" box's shape swatches read "Human" (circle) and "Service" (octagon) rather than a single "Member" circle. A gray region far from the legend column is the other possibility — a graph shape still filled with the retired Delegate color, which PNG-10 will also flag as a count mismatch. Note the limit: this detects the *absence* of the retired swatch, not the *presence* of the correct new one, since reading swatch labels and telling a circle from an octagon would need text and shape recognition rather than exact-color sampling. The circle/octagon distinction stays a visual check for the same reason (see PNG-1c).

## TTL — triple checks

These read a `.ttl` file and ask a question about **triples**, so every one parses with `rdflib` rather than regex. See [Which checks use `rdflib`](#which-checks-use-rdflib) above for why that matters and why no other kind may follow suit.


**TTL-1 — No orphan Persons**: Every `persona:Person` individual other than `:Self` must be reachable via `BFO_0000115` (has member part) from a Social Network individual linked to another `persona:Person` via `persona:hasSocialNetwork`. `:Self` is always the root and needs no incoming link. Since graphs are embedded graph sections across every pod-databook under `example/Pods/**`, this check's scope is the merged whole-tree dump (example.md's "Merged whole-tree dump"), which spans every embedded graph. **Exception**: a `persona:Person` referenced only via a professional/service-designation property (`medicalappointments:hasPrimaryCarePhysician` is the only one so far) rather than social-network membership is exempt — it represents a service relationship (e.g. a physician), not a social connection, so it has no social network to be reachable from. Example: `:Jane_Starostina`, Sophia Walker's primary care physician — introduced as a `persona:Person` in graph #25 and reached by that property from graph #26. The exempting properties are listed in `DESIGNATION` in the script below, and that list is the whole of what keeps the exemption honest: a property minted later and left out of it will surface its subject as an orphan, which is the intended failure rather than a false positive. Run:

```python
import subprocess, sys
import rdflib

TPOD = rdflib.Namespace('http://www.example.org/tpod#')
PER  = rdflib.URIRef('http://mee.foundation/ontologies/persona#Person')
SN   = rdflib.URIRef('http://mee.foundation/ontologies/persona#hasSocialNetwork')
PART = rdflib.URIRef('http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000115')

# Professional/service-designation properties: a Person reached ONLY through one
# of these is exempt (see the Exception above). Add to this list when a new such
# property is minted -- that is the whole of what keeps the exemption honest.
DESIGNATION = [
    rdflib.URIRef('http://mee.foundation/ontologies/medical-appointments#hasPrimaryCarePhysician'),
]

dump = subprocess.run([sys.executable, 'helpers/extract-all.py'],
                      capture_output=True, text=True, check=True).stdout
g = rdflib.Graph(); g.parse(data=dump, format='turtle')

name    = lambda u: str(u).split('#')[-1]
persons = {s for s in g.subjects(rdflib.RDF.type, PER)}
reached = {m for p in persons for n in g.objects(p, SN) for m in g.objects(n, PART)}
exempt  = {o for prop in DESIGNATION for o in g.objects(None, prop)}

orphans = sorted(name(p) for p in persons - reached - exempt - {TPOD.Self})
if orphans:
    print(f"ORPHAN Person(s), in no social network: {', '.join(orphans)}")
    print("  Fix: add each to a Social Network individual via BFO_0000115 in the graph")
    print("  that introduces them, or -- if the reference is a service relationship --")
    print("  add its designation property to DESIGNATION above.")
else:
    print(f"No orphan Persons: {len(persons)} persona:Person individuals, "
          f"{len(exempt)} exempt by designation.")
```

This is the one check script that uses `rdflib` rather than regex/YAML parsing like the rest: the question is genuine graph reachability over a merged dump whose `BFO_0000115` values are written as multi-object lists, which a regex would read wrong. `rdflib` is already a dependency of `helpers/draw.py` and `helpers/validate.py`, so this adds nothing new to install.

**TTL-2 — IRI roots: `mee.foundation/ontologies` for foundational files, `www.example.org` for example data**: Every foundational ontology and SHACL shapes file — `persona.ttl`, `pod.ttl`, `pod-categories.ttl`, `pod-category-templates.ttl`, `organization.ttl`, `service.ttl`, every `*-shacl.ttl` companion (each living in a `shacl/` subfolder directly below the ontology file it validates — the foundational ones under the repo-root `shacl/`, each `other/*.ttl` peer ontology's own under `other/shacl/`, one recursive glob covers all of them), and every `other/*.ttl` peer ontology (`other/pets.ttl`, `other/vehicles.ttl`, `other/identity-documents.ttl`, globbed the same way) — must declare its `owl:Ontology` IRI under `http://mee.foundation/ontologies/`. There is no separate canonical category/pod DataBook tree to check — the canonical tree's IRI roots are covered by `pod-categories.ttl`/`pod-category-templates.ttl` themselves. Every DataBook under `example/Pods/` (excluding `under-development/`) represents Alice's own example instance data, so both its own `id:` and every `tpod.member[]`/`tpod.tool[].graph[].id` value it carries must be grounded under `http://www.example.org/` — `https://` is deliberately rejected here, not just accepted alongside it, since every identifier in the example tree (pod ids and graph ids alike) was standardized on the plain `http://` scheme for consistency; a stray `https://` is exactly the kind of drift this check exists to catch. Run:

```python
import os, re, glob, yaml
import rdflib

FOUNDATIONAL_TTL = [
    'persona.ttl', 'pod.ttl', 'pod-categories.ttl', 'pod-category-templates.ttl',
    'organization.ttl', 'service.ttl',

If a violation is found, rename the offending file's `owl:Ontology`/`id:` IRI to the correct root, and update every catalog entry and cross-reference that pointed at the old IRI to match (see FS-1's validation commands, which also hardcode these IRIs).

**TTL-3 — `pod:shape`'s declared shape must resolve to an `rdf:type` actually asserted in the graph's own embedded Turtle body**: `pod:shape` (`pod.ttl`) is a real `owl:AnnotationProperty` (domain `pod:Graph`, range `sh:NodeShape`, cardinality 0..N), synthesized into RDF from each `tpod.member[]`/`tpod.tool[].graph[].shape` YAML value by `helpers/yaml-to-rdf.py`. But SHACL validation of a templated graph never actually reads this synthesized triple — each per-template shape (e.g. `:PassportShape`) fires purely via its own `sh:targetClass`, matching whatever `rdf:type` is asserted directly in the graph's body (e.g. `:Alice_US_Passport rdf:type identitydocuments:Passport`), completely independent of `shape:`. So nothing else cross-checks that a graph's declared `shape:` shape's own `sh:targetClass` actually names a class asserted on an individual in its own body — a typo'd or stale `shape:` value would go undetected, silently decoupled from what SHACL is actually validating. This is not itself an OWL/SHACL-expressible constraint (same reasoning as YAML-4/YAML-6/YAML-7/YAML-8 — it requires dereferencing the graph's own embedded Turtle content, not just its YAML frontmatter), so it's checked here instead. For every pod-databook under `example/Pods/` (excluding `under-development/`) with a `tpod.member[]`/`tpod.tool[].graph[].shape` value, resolve that shape CURIE to its own `sh:targetClass` (scanning `shacl/persona-shacl.ttl`/`shacl/contactinfo-shacl.ttl` and every `other/shacl/`, `persona-ext/shacl/`, and `pod-category-ext/shacl/` shapes file for the matching shape — the recursive `**/shacl/*.ttl` glob TTL-2 already describes, and the same scan TTL-4 runs), then verify that same graph's own embedded Turtle body asserts `rdf:type` (directly, on some individual) to that resolved class. **Exempt**: `pshapes:ContactInfoShape` and `bhsshapes:MemberShape` — per `helpers/validate.py`'s own module docstring, these are the broad, class-wide shapes (`sh:targetClass persona:Person`) that `helpers/validate.py` re-targets, at actual validation time, at only the *substantive* `persona:Person` individual(s) present in a graph, precisely because it's legitimate for a `pod:member`-list graph (required to carry this shape unconditionally, per TTL-7) to contain none at all — e.g. graph-01 (`Boston Hub Society.databook.md`, whose member shape is `bhsshapes:MemberShape` rather than `ContactInfoShape` — the exemption covers both for exactly the same reason) is the society's own member stub, typing `:BHS_Service` as `service:ServiceProvider` and `:BHS` as `o:Organization`, never `persona:Person`; graph-27 (`Citibank(banking-payments).databook.md`) is the bank's own member stub, carrying its name, website, and institutional self-description, typing `:Citibank_Service`/`:Citibank` the same way; and graph-96 (`Arca(companies).databook.md`) is a backup service's own member stub, typing `:Arca_Backup` as `service:ArcaBackup` and `:Arca` as `o:Organization` — both correctly, vacuously satisfy `ContactInfoShape` in real SHACL validation with zero `persona:Person` individuals present. Every other shape (e.g. `idocshapes:PassportShape`, `bankingshapes:DebitCardShape`) targets a narrow, specific document/account class that a declaring graph always does instantiate for real (e.g. the real Citibank debit-card graph asserts `rdf:type cco:ent00000051` directly, alongside `banking:DebitCard`), so no other exemption is needed.

If a violation is found: fix whichever side is wrong — either the `shape:` YAML value (if the graph's own asserted `rdf:type` is correct and `template:` names the wrong shape), or the body's `rdf:type` (if `template:` reflects the intended classification and the body was never updated to match).

**TTL-4 — a `member` graph's `shape:` value, and a declared tool's graph's, must be among its pod's own `TemplatePod`'s `memberShape`/`formShape` values**: TTL-3 only compares a graph's `shape:` value against its own body content — this check goes one level higher, comparing it against what the pod's *category* itself declares as authoritative. For every pod-databook under `example/Pods/` (excluding `under-development/`) whose `tpod.category` value names a concept with a matching `pod:TemplatePod` in `pod-category-templates.ttl` (reverse lookup, per YAML-4/README's Lazy Instantiation pattern — a category with no such template has nothing to check here; a defensive branch, not a live case today, since TTL-6 guarantees every `pod-categories.ttl` concept except `podcat:Person`/`podcat:Organization` has one): every `tpod.member`-list graph carrying a `shape:` value must have that value be one of the TemplatePod's own `pod:memberShape` value(s); and, **only when that TemplatePod declares a tool at all**, every tool graph carrying a `shape:` value must be among the declared tool's own `pod:formShape` value(s) — direct CURIE-set membership, since `pod:shape`'s range is `sh:NodeShape` (`pod.ttl`), the same range `pod:memberShape`/`pod:formShape` already carry, so no `sh:targetClass` resolution and no named exemptions are needed any more. A tool on a pod whose category declares none is **not** checked against any shape at all: any pod may gain a tool its category never declared, and the user picks that tool's shape themselves — from the app's full list of shapes, not from anything the pod's category declares — so the category's own `TemplatePod` has no authority over it. A category that declares no tool offers no shape hint either. This is not itself an OWL/SHACL-expressible constraint (same reasoning as YAML-4/YAML-6/YAML-7/YAML-8/TTL-3 — it requires dereferencing values across `pod-category-templates.ttl`, not just pod-databook YAML), so it's checked here instead.

If a violation is found: either the graph's `shape:` value is wrong (fix it to match the shape actually reachable via the pod's `category`), or the `pod:memberShape` value or the declared tool's `pod:formShape` value(s) on the corresponding `pod-category-templates.ttl` individual are wrong/missing (add the correct one), or — if the graph is genuinely a different kind of content than its category's template expects — reconsider whether it belongs in `member` vs. under a tool, or under this category at all.

**TTL-5 — every `pod:member` graph of a categorized pod must carry every `pod:shape` value its category's `TemplatePod` requires**: TTL-4 only checks a `template:` value once one is already present — it never flags a `tpod.member`-list graph that's missing one outright. This check closes that gap: the mapping is unconditional — whenever a `pod:TemplatePod` of category X carries one or more `pod:memberShape` values, **every** real pod of category X must have every one of its `tpod.member`-list graphs carry those exact shape CURIEs as `pod:shape` value(s) too, with no exception for which shape it happens to be (see `app-behavior.md`'s Lazy Instantiation section) — direct CURIE-set membership, since `pod:shape`'s range is `sh:NodeShape` (`pod.ttl`), the same range `pod:memberShape` already carries, so no label resolution and no named exceptions are needed any more. For every pod-databook under `example/Pods/` (excluding `under-development/`) whose `tpod.category` value names a concept with a matching `pod:TemplatePod` in `pod-category-templates.ttl` that carries at least one `pod:memberShape` value: every `tpod.member`-list graph must carry a `shape:` value (or list of values) that includes each of those shape CURIEs. A category with no `pod:TemplatePod` at all has nothing to check here — a defensive branch, not a live case today, since TTL-6 guarantees every `pod-categories.ttl` concept except `podcat:Person`/`podcat:Organization` has one. This is not itself an OWL/SHACL-expressible constraint (same reasoning as YAML-4/YAML-6/YAML-7/YAML-8/TTL-3/TTL-4 — it requires dereferencing values across `pod-category-templates.ttl`, not just pod-databook YAML), so it's checked here instead.

```

If a violation is found: add the missing `shape:` value(s) to the graph's own `tpod.member[]`/`tpod.tool[].graph[]` entry, and verify (per TTL-3) that the graph's own individual — usually its `:Self` claim, per the required minimal `GivenName` stub — actually satisfies the shape's constraints; if it doesn't yet, add the missing content rather than just the template value.

**TTL-6 — every category concept has a matching `pod:TemplatePod`**: Every `skos:Concept` in `pod-categories.ttl`'s `podcat:PodCategoryScheme` — **including** the two SKOS top concepts `podcat:Person`/`podcat:Organization`, which a real pod may legitimately be instantiated as (`Pods(person)` is the root of the user's own tree; `Acme(organization)` stands for an employer) — must have a matching `pod:TemplatePod` in `pod-category-templates.ttl` carrying that same `pod:category` value. This is the reverse direction of TTL-4/TTL-5's own reverse lookup (`?tc pod:category podcat:X`): those checks skip a category outright when it has no `TemplatePod` at all, so nothing previously caught a category that should have one but doesn't. This is not itself an OWL/SHACL-expressible constraint (same reasoning as YAML-4/YAML-6/YAML-7/YAML-8/TTL-3/TTL-4/TTL-5 — it requires cross-referencing every concept in `pod-categories.ttl` against every individual in `pod-category-templates.ttl`, not just parsing one file's own YAML or Turtle in isolation), so it's checked here instead. Run:

```python
import rdflib

SKOS  = rdflib.Namespace('http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#')

                      for l in cats.objects(s, SKOS.prefLabel)}

tpl = rdflib.Graph(); tpl.parse('pod-category-templates.ttl', format='turtle')
# Only the object of a real pod:category triple counts. A regex over the file
# text would also match the phrase inside ctpl:UserDefinedTemplatePod's own
# rdfs:comment, which cites "?tc pod:category podcat:X" as prose.
existing = {o for s in tpl.subjects(rdflib.RDF.type, POD.TemplatePod)
              for o in tpl.objects(s, POD.category)}

violations = 0
for c in sorted(set(concepts) - existing, key=curie):
    violations += 1
    print(f"VIOLATION: {curie(c)} ({concepts[c]!r}) has no matching pod:TemplatePod in pod-category-templates.ttl")
print("Every category concept, top concepts included, has a matching TemplatePod."
      if violations == 0 else f'{violations} violation(s) found.')
```

If a violation is found: add a new `ctpl:XTemplatePod` individual to `pod-category-templates.ttl` for the missing category, following the standard pattern for a category with no document type of its own — `pod:memberShape pshapes:ContactInfoShape` and no `pod:declaresTool` at all — unless the category genuinely has its own document/record type, in which case follow the pattern of an existing tool-declaring template instead (see `pod-category-templates.ttl`'s row in core-files.md). Adding a new `TemplatePod` also brings the category into scope for TTL-4/TTL-5 and `helpers/validate.py` — re-run those afterward, since any real pod already using that category will now need its own `tpod.member` graph(s) tagged with the matching `pod:shape` value (TTL-5) and may need minimal `GivenName` content added if it doesn't already have any (TTL-3 and the template pass).

**TTL-7 — every `pod:TemplatePod` individual carries a `pod:memberShape`, and every one in `pod-category-templates.ttl` carries `pshapes:ContactInfoShape`**: Every `pod:memberShape` value in `pod-category-templates.ttl` is the identical `pshapes:ContactInfoShape` — a `pod:member` graph is always validated as a basic contact-info profile, regardless of category, while any category-specific content lives in a tool instead (see `app-behavior.md`'s Lazy Instantiation section). This is asserted directly and explicitly on every individual, on purpose — not hoisted onto the `pod:TemplatePod` class itself via an OWL restriction, since nothing in this project's own validation pipeline runs a reasoner to materialize such an entailment (`helpers/validate.py` validates literal asserted triples only, via `riot`/`shacl validate`), and TTL-4/TTL-5/TTL-6 above all rely on literally finding this triple in each individual's own block. This check exists to catch a new `TemplatePod` added without it (e.g. by hand, skipping the standard pattern), which SHACL itself wouldn't catch either (`shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:TemplatePodShape` allows zero or more `pod:memberShape` values, no minimum). This is not itself an OWL/SHACL-expressible constraint (same reasoning as TTL-6 above), so it's checked here instead.

The uniformity claim is scoped to `pod-category-templates.ttl` deliberately, and that scoping is the whole point: a template pod published by a **category extension** (`pod-category-ext/`, see TTL-8) may name any member shape it likes, which is what `pod:memberShape` exists for. `bhscat:BostonHubSocietyTemplatePod` is the first to exercise this, naming `bhsshapes:MemberShape` — the Boston Hub Society's own two-page directory form — in place of `ContactInfoShape`. So the check runs in two halves: **every** `pod:TemplatePod` anywhere must carry at least one `pod:memberShape` value (a template naming none validates nothing, which is always a mistake), and every one **in `pod-category-templates.ttl`** must carry `pshapes:ContactInfoShape` specifically (the app's own shipped templates stay uniform; variation arrives only with an extension). Run:

```python

CONTACT = rdflib.URIRef('http://mee.foundation/ontologies/persona/shapes#ContactInfoShape')

```

If a violation is found: add a `pod:memberShape` value to the offending `TemplatePod` individual. In `pod-category-templates.ttl` that value is `pshapes:ContactInfoShape`, with no exception. In a `pod-category-ext/` bundle it is whichever shape that extension publishes — the point of an extension being that it may differ. A `TemplatePod` with no `pod:memberShape` at all is always wrong: TTL-5 would then require nothing of that category's member graphs, and they would go unvalidated.

**TTL-8 — every category extension's concepts map into the core taxonomy, and each has a template pod**: A **category extension** (`pod-category-ext/`) is a bundle an organization publishes so other instances can file and validate pods of a category `pod-categories.ttl` does not define: one file carrying the publisher's own `skos:ConceptScheme`, the concepts in it, and a `pod:TemplatePod` for each, with its member shape beside it in `pod-category-ext/shacl/`. `pod-categories.ttl` and `pod-category-templates.ttl` never change to accommodate one — which is exactly why TTL-6 and TTL-7 can keep their own scoping, and why `images/pod-categories/pod-categories.png` (PNG-5) stays correct as extensions are added.

The mechanism is SKOS's own. `skos:broader` is defined for hierarchy *within* one concept scheme; the `skos:mappingRelation` family, of which `skos:broadMatch` is one, is defined for links *between* schemes. An extension concept is by definition in another scheme, so it links to the core taxonomy with `skos:broadMatch` and never with `skos:broader`. That link is load-bearing rather than decorative: a recipient whose app does not have the extension installed still needs somewhere to file an incoming pod, and the `broadMatch` target is that somewhere.

`shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:PodShape` carries half of this — a `pod:category` value must be a `skos:Concept` with at least one `skos:inScheme` value that is a `skos:ConceptScheme` — but it deliberately no longer pins that scheme to `podcat:PodCategoryScheme`, since an extension concept is never in it. The other half is not SHACL-expressible (it requires dereferencing across `pod-category-ext/` and `pod-categories.ttl` at once, the same reasoning as TTL-4/TTL-5/TTL-6), so it is checked here. For every `pod-category-ext/*.ttl` file, every `skos:Concept` in it must:

- **39a** — carry `skos:inScheme` naming a scheme declared in that same file, and **not** `podcat:PodCategoryScheme`. An extension concept that claimed core-scheme membership would be caught by TTL-6 as a core concept with no `pod-category-templates.ttl` entry.
- **39b** — carry exactly one `skos:broadMatch`, whose value is a `podcat:` concept. One, not zero (nowhere to file it) and not several (no single answer to where).
- **39c** — carry no `skos:broader` at all, that predicate being reserved for within-scheme hierarchy. An extension with a hierarchy *of its own* may use `skos:broader` between two of its own concepts; what 39c forbids is a `skos:broader` pointing at a `podcat:` concept, which is the misuse `skos:broadMatch` exists to replace.
- **39d** — have a matching `pod:TemplatePod` in that same file, carrying that concept as its `pod:category` value — the extension's own analogue of TTL-6, and what makes the reverse lookup in TTL-4/TTL-5 resolve for a pod of this category.

If a violation is found: for **39a**/**39b**/**39c**, fix the concept's own block — it belongs to its publisher's scheme and reaches the core taxonomy only through a single `skos:broadMatch`. For **39d**, add a `pod:TemplatePod` for it to the same file, carrying `pod:category` naming the concept and a `pod:memberShape` naming whichever shape the extension publishes (TTL-7's second half requires the `pod:memberShape`; unlike a `pod-category-templates.ttl` template, it need not be `pshapes:ContactInfoShape` — a bundle differing there is the entire purpose of an extension).

## YAML — pod DataBook checks

These read a pod DataBook's **YAML frontmatter**, and sometimes its Markdown body, exactly as written — before any triple is synthesized from it. That is the point: several of them hunt malformations that synthesis would coerce, drop, or collapse away.


**YAML-1 — Graph id naming convention**: Every `tpod.member[]`/`tpod.tool[].graph[]` entry's own `id` value's local-name (the string after the final `/`) — across all pod-databooks in `example/Pods/` — must follow the flat pattern `graph-<NN>`, where `<NN>` is the graph's own number — zero-padded to two digits up to `graph-99`, three digits from `graph-100` on — matching the graph's own diagram label, `### Graph NN` body heading, and `<a id="graph-NN">` anchor. If an id does not match this pattern, flag it rather than silently renaming — the entry's `id` also doubles as the graph's own named-graph identity (`{id}#graph`), so changing it is a bigger operation than a file rename ever was.

**YAML-2 — `member`/`tool` entry well-formedness** (the format itself is specified in [pod-databook.md](pod-databook.md#the-tpod-block)): Each `tpod.member` entry carries a graph's full metadata directly (`id`, `claimant`, `subject`, and optionally `shape`), and each `tpod.tool` entry carries its own `type`/`formTopic` plus a nested `graph` list whose entries carry `id`, `claimant` and optionally `shape` — rather than a bare local-name reference into a separate list, so there's no cross-list consistency left to check. A tool graph carries no about-ness field of its own: its topic is the tool's single `formTopic`, which is exactly what makes several members' claims unable to disagree about what they are about. `formTopic` and the nested `graph` list are both scoped to a **form** tool (`pod:Form` is the one tool class with a content model — see `pod.ttl`'s Pod Tools section), so a `calendar` or `canvas` entry carries neither. But a malformed entry (e.g. a stray bare string left over from a hand edit, or a missing required field) would otherwise go unnoticed. Which about-ness field an entry carries depends on which list it sits in, since the two lists hold different classes of graph (`pod.ttl`): a `tpod.member` entry is a `pod:MemberGraph` and carries `subject`, while a `tpod.tool[].graph` entry is a `pod:FormGraph` and carries no about-ness field of its own — its topic is the holding tool's single `formTopic`. Neither kind ever carries the other's field — they are `owl:disjointWith`, enforced by `shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:FormGraphShape` `sh:maxCount 0` guard. For every pod-databook under `example/Pods/`, verify that every `tpod.member` entry and every tool graph is a mapping (never a bare string), that its `id` matches the `graph-<NN>` id pattern (see YAML-1), that `claimant` is present (required on both kinds, per `:CGraphShape`), and that the entry carries exactly its own list's about-ness field and not the other's; `template` stays optional (see TTL-5 for when it's actually required).

If a malformed entry is found, fix it directly (turn a stray bare string back into a full mapping, correct the id, or add the missing `claimant`/`subject`/`formTopic`).

**YAML-3 — Pod id naming convention**: This check applies only to `example/Pods/` — the user's own instance tree — since there is no separate canonical-instance file tree: the canonical tree is the `podcat:PodCategoryScheme` SKOS concept scheme in `pod-categories.ttl` itself, with class-level templates in `pod-category-templates.ttl`. A pod-databook's `id:` is deliberately independent of its filename — the filename stays the folder's own verbatim name per the [Filename Convention](pod-databook.md#filename-convention), but the `id:` value is a flat, opaque, globally-unique identifier, following the same reasoning and pattern as the [Graph Ids and Named Graphs](pod-databook.md#graph-ids)'s `graph-<NN>`: encoding the folder's name and catType into the id would risk a collision the moment two different folders elsewhere in the tree shared both a name and a catType, and nothing in the repo actually depends on the id's string *structure* — it's purely a self-contained RDF subject identifier for that one pod, never cross-referenced by another pod, a graph, or a catalog file. Every `id:` value — across all pod-databooks in `example/Pods/` — must follow the flat pattern `http://www.example.org/tpod/pods/pod-<NN>`, where `<NN>` is a zero-padded two-digit number, assigned once at creation and never reused or renumbered. Every `<NN>` must be globally unique across the whole tree. Run:

```python
import glob, re

pattern = re.compile(r'^http://www\.example\.org/tpod/pods/pod-(\d{2})$')
seen = {}
errors = 0
for path in sorted(glob.glob('example/Pods/**/*.databook.md', recursive=True)):
    if 'under-development' in path.split('/'):
        continue
    text = open(path).read()
    m = re.search(r'^id:\s*(\S+)', text, re.MULTILINE)
    fid = m.group(1).strip() if m else ''
    pm = pattern.match(fid)
    if not pm:
        print(f'MALFORMED  {path}  id={fid!r} does not match http://www.example.org/tpod/pods/pod-<NN>')
        errors += 1
        continue
    nn = pm.group(1)
    if nn in seen:
        print(f'DUPLICATE  pod-{nn}  used by both {seen[nn]!r} and {path!r}')
        errors += 1
    else:
        seen[nn] = path
print('YAML-3: OK' if errors == 0 else f'YAML-3: {errors} issue(s) found')
```

If a malformed id is found, fix it to match the pattern. If a duplicate `<NN>` is found, assign the newer pod the next unused number — never renumber an existing pod's id, since (like a graph id) it may already be referenced by an external peer over the PDN. This rule has no exceptions for `example/Pods/`, fictional as its data is — treat every id there exactly as if a real external PDN peer might already hold a reference to it.

Note: this check's `^id:\s*(\S+)` regex is anchored at true line-start with no leading whitespace, so it only ever matches a file's own top-level `id:` line — a nested, indented `tpod.member[]`/`tpod.tool[].graph[].id` value never matches this anchor and is intentionally out of scope here (a graph's `id` is not expected to relate to its owning pod file's name at all; see YAML-1 for that). This imposes a requirement on any script that writes `tpod.member`/`tpod.tool`: never emit an unindented `id:` at column 0.

**YAML-4 — a pod's subject is derived from its tools plus `member`, never stored**: There is no independently-asserted pod-level subject property (nor a pod-level `tpod.subject` field — the `subject:` key sits inside each `tpod.member` entry, naming that member) — who or what a pod's relationship is about is computed, not stored, by a simple two-branch rule. The two branches read properties at *different levels*, since a tool states its topic once for all the graphs beneath it while a member entry carries its own subject directly (`pod.ttl`): a `member` entry is a `pod:MemberGraph` carrying `pod:subject`, while a tool's graphs are `pod:FormGraph`s carrying no about-ness of their own, the tool's single `pod:formTopic` standing for all of them. **If the pod has any form tools**, the full set of distinct `pod:formTopic` values among them is the pod's subject (e.g. `Medical Appointment.databook.md`, a two-member pod: `member` holds Dave's and Self's graphs, and its one form tool is about Sophia — subject is `:Sophia_Walker`); **otherwise** the subject is the full set of distinct `pod:subject` values among `member` — the pod's own active members (e.g. `Bob Johnson(others).databook.md`, a two-member pod with no tool: subject is `:Self` and `:Bob_Johnson` together; `Fred Flintstone(others).databook.md`, likewise: `:Self` and `:Fred_Flintstone` together). `Boston Hub Society.databook.md` shows the first branch taking over from the second: as a three-member pod it would derive `:BHS_Service`, `:Bob_Johnson`, and `:Self` together, but its one manually-added form tool — BHS's own organizational profile, claimed by BHS — narrows the derived subject to `:BHS` alone. Every real example pod today carries at most one tool, but the rule and this check both generalize to any number, a pod being free to hold as many tools as it likes. A tool's topic is explicitly **allowed** to duplicate a `member` subject — this is the normal shape for every template-declared form tool whose pod's `pod:member` content is just the generic `ContactInfoShape` contact-info stub (claimed by and about `:Self`) while the pod's real content lives in the tool, also about `:Self` (e.g. `Google(companies).databook.md`, `SSN.databook.md`, `Paradise(home).databook.md`): the stub `member` isn't a distinct party the derived subject needs to separately surface, so the derivation switching to the tool set alone (ignoring `member`) is intended, not a masking bug. This check therefore only reports each pod's derived subject for reference — it does not flag member/tool subject overlap as a violation. Run:

```python
import re, yaml, glob

def frontmatter(path):
    text = open(path, encoding='utf-8').read()
    m = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', text, re.DOTALL)
    return yaml.safe_load(m.group(1)) if m else None

for f in glob.glob('example/Pods/**/*.databook.md', recursive=True):
    fm = frontmatter(f)
    if not fm:
        continue
    tpod = fm.get('tpod', {}) or {}
    if not tpod.get('member'):
        continue
    # A member entry carries its own subject directly; a tool carries one
    # topic for all its graphs at once, so the two branches read different
    # levels (pod:subject on the graph vs pod:formTopic on the tool).
    pt = tpod.get('member') or []
    pt = pt if isinstance(pt, list) else [pt]
    tools = tpod.get('tool') or []
    tools = tools if isinstance(tools, list) else [tools]
    pt_subs = {t.get('subject') for t in pt}
    # pod:formTopic is scoped to pod:Form, so only a form tool
    # contributes; a pod holding only a calendar or canvas falls to the
    # pod:member branch below.
    form_tools = [t for t in tools if t.get('type', 'form') == 'form']
    tool_subs = {t.get('formTopic') for t in form_tools}
    derived = tool_subs if form_tools else pt_subs
    print(f'derived subject={sorted(s for s in derived if s)} {f}')
print()
print('Derived subjects listed above for every pod — member/tool subject overlap is allowed, not a violation.')
```

**YAML-5 — Pod-databook `title:` is the pod's name and matches its own folder's OS name** (a scaffolding check — at runtime there is no folder at all, and the app's own record of the name is authoritative outright): `title:` is defined as the pod's own name — it is always exactly the name of the filesystem folder that holds the pod-databook, and the two are kept in sync (a folder rename means updating `title:` to match, never the reverse); `title:` is never an independent display-name override of the folder's name. The [Filename Convention](pod-databook.md#filename-convention) already requires a pod-databook's *filename root* to be an exact copy of its folder's own name, but that convention is about the filename — not the separate `title:` YAML field, which several other checks (notably PNG-1a's box-label match) treat as authoritative for what a pod "is called." The invariant: for every pod-databook under `example/Pods/`, `title:` must equal `os.path.basename` of the folder it directly lives in, verbatim (same case/spacing/punctuation rule as the filename convention — no kebab-casing, no paraphrasing). Run:

```python
import os, re, yaml

def frontmatter(path):
    text = open(path, encoding='utf-8').read()
    m = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', text, re.DOTALL)
    return yaml.safe_load(m.group(1)) if m else None

errors = 0
for dirpath, _, filenames in os.walk('example/Pods'):
    if 'under-development' in dirpath.split(os.sep):
        continue
    pods = [f for f in filenames if f.endswith('.databook.md')]
    for fname in pods:
        path = os.path.join(dirpath, fname)
        fm = frontmatter(path)
        if not fm:
            continue
        title = fm.get('title')
        folder_name = os.path.basename(dirpath)
        if title != folder_name:
            print(f'MISMATCH  {path}  folder={folder_name!r}  title={title!r}')
            errors += 1
print('OK — title: matches its own folder name for every pod-databook.' if errors == 0 else f'{errors} mismatch(es) found.')
```

If a mismatch is found, the folder name is authoritative within this scaffolding — update `title:` to match it exactly, even when the existing `title:` reads more naturally (e.g. an honorific like `Dr. Jane Starostina` vs. folder `Jane Starostina`, or an expansion like `AT&T` vs. folder `ATT`): `title:` is not an independent display-name override, so it cannot legitimately diverge from the folder's own name — the mismatch is drift, not a deliberate choice, since the folder name is also what PNG-1a's diagram-box match keys off. If the *folder's* name is what's actually wrong (e.g. it should have been named `AT&T` all along), rename the folder itself instead, then update the pod-databook's filename and `title:` together to match the new folder name.

**YAML-6 — `:Self` must be a member of every pod in the user's own tree**: A pod-databook under `example/Pods/` — the user's own instance tree — can only ever have gotten there one of two ways: (1) the user created it themselves, in which case they (`:Self`) are trivially a member, or (2) someone else shared it with the user, in which case the share necessarily made `:Self` a member (a pod can't be "shared with" someone without them becoming a member of it). Either way, `:Self` must be one of the pod's active members — i.e. `:Self` must be the `pod:subject` of at least one of that pod's `member` — for **every** pod in `example/Pods/`, regardless of how many members the pod has or what the pod's derived subject (YAML-4) is. This is strictest for a pod with only one `member` entry: that entry's subject must be `:Self`, full stop — never a tool's own `pod:formTopic` (see YAML-4's placement rule above), even when the pod's derived-from-tool subject is a third party (e.g. `Jane_Starostina`, `Sophia_Walker`, `Ginger`) and no other graph happens to exist yet. Pods with more members have more room, so `:Self` just needs to be one of the members alongside whichever other real members the pod has (already satisfied by every existing example, e.g. Bob Johnson, Fred Flintstone, Medical Appointment, Boston Hub Society). This is not itself an OWL/SHACL-expressible constraint (same reasoning as YAML-4 — it requires dereferencing each `member` value's own `subject`, not just counting or matching cardinalities), so it's checked here instead. Run:

```python
import re, yaml, glob

def frontmatter(path):
    text = open(path, encoding='utf-8').read()
    m = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', text, re.DOTALL)
    return yaml.safe_load(m.group(1)) if m else None

violations = 0
for f in glob.glob('example/Pods/**/*.databook.md', recursive=True):
    if 'under-development' in f.split('/'):
        continue
    fm = frontmatter(f)
    if not fm:
        continue
    tpod = fm.get('tpod', {}) or {}
    if not tpod.get('member'):
        continue
    pt = tpod.get('member') or []
    pt = pt if isinstance(pt, list) else [pt]
    subs = [t.get('subject') for t in pt]
    if not any(s == ':Self' for s in subs):
        violations += 1
        print(f'VIOLATION member-subjects={subs} (no :Self) {f}')
print('All pods have :Self as a member.' if violations == 0 else f'{violations} violation(s) found.')
```

If a violation is found, add a new minimal graph claimed by and about `:Self` (following the pattern in `Medical.databook.md` under `Pets/Ginger/`, `Jane-Starostina(primary-care-physician).databook.md`, or `Health & Wellness.databook.md` — a single `designated by` → `GivenName` triple is enough), assign it the next free `graph-<NN>`, put it in `member`, and move whatever was in that slot under a `tool` entry instead.

If a diagram box's fill or text color doesn't match this script's output for the corresponding real folder, the diagram wins (per PNG-1's own rule) — update `tpod.category`/`title:`/filename only if the *data* is actually wrong, otherwise redraw the box.

**YAML-7 — `pod:owner`'s two subset invariants: creator ⊆ owner, and owner ⊆ member-subjects**: There is no OWL/SHACL-expressible way to check either invariant, since both require dereferencing values or comparing across fields rather than counting/matching a single path's cardinality — the same reasoning as YAML-4/YAML-6. For every pod-databook under `example/Pods/` (excluding `under-development/`) with a `tpod.owner` value: (a) `tpod.creator`'s own value must appear among `tpod.owner`'s values — the creator is always at least the pod's initial owner, and this repo's example data never demonstrates a promotion, so today `tpod.owner` always equals exactly `[tpod.creator]`, but the check only requires creator ⊆ owner, not equality, so a future example demonstrating promotion (owner as a proper superset of creator) would still pass; (b) every value in `tpod.owner` must equal the `pod:subject` of at least one of that pod's `tpod.member` graphs — an owner must always be one of the pod's actual members, never a non-member. Run:

```python
import re, yaml, glob

def frontmatter(path):
    text = open(path, encoding='utf-8').read()
    m = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', text, re.DOTALL)
    return yaml.safe_load(m.group(1)) if m else None

violations = 0
for f in glob.glob('example/Pods/**/*.databook.md', recursive=True):
    if 'under-development' in f.split('/'):
        continue
    fm = frontmatter(f)
    if not fm:
        continue
    tpod = fm.get('tpod', {}) or {}
    owner = tpod.get('owner') or []
    owner = owner if isinstance(owner, list) else [owner]
    if not owner:
        continue
    creator = tpod.get('creator')
    if creator and creator not in owner:
        violations += 1
        print(f'VIOLATION {f}: creator {creator!r} not in owner {owner!r} (creator must be a subset of owner)')

    mt = tpod.get('member') or []
    mt = mt if isinstance(mt, list) else [mt]
    member_subs = {t.get('subject') for t in mt}
    bad_owners = [o for o in owner if o not in member_subs]
    if bad_owners:
        violations += 1
        print(f'VIOLATION {f}: owner value(s) {bad_owners} not among member subjects {sorted(s for s in member_subs if s)}')
print('All pods satisfy the owner subset invariants.' if violations == 0 else f'{violations} violation(s) found.')
```

If a violation is found: for (a), add the missing creator value to `tpod.owner`. For (b), either add a `tpod.member` graph whose subject matches the owner value, or remove that value from `tpod.owner` if it doesn't actually belong.

**YAML-8 — `pod:formGraph`'s real upper bound is the pod's own member count: one graph per member, each with a distinct claimant**: `pod:formGraph` carries no OWL/SHACL-expressible maximum — `shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:LiveToolShape` asserts only `sh:minCount 1` — but in practice its upper bound is exactly the pod's own member count, since every value represents one of the pod's own members making their own claim about the tool's single `pod:formTopic` (see README.md's Tools section). Concretely, two things must both hold for every tool on every pod-databook under `example/Pods/` (excluding `under-development/`): (a) each tool graph's `pod:claimant` must resolve to one of that same pod's own members — a tool's graph is never claimed by a non-member; and (b) within one tool, no two graphs may share the same claimant — each member gets at most one claim on that tool's topic. Together these two facts are what actually cap the count at the member count, rather than any cardinality restriction. The cap is per tool, not per pod: a pod carrying several tools may hold as many graphs in total as it has tools times members. This is not itself an OWL/SHACL-expressible constraint (same reasoning as YAML-4/YAML-6/YAML-7 — it requires dereferencing each graph's own `claimant`, and each `member` value's own `subject`, not just counting or matching cardinalities), so it's checked here instead.

"Resolves to one of the pod's members" is satisfied two ways, because a claimant is the party *really* making the claim rather than the member that mechanically carries it (see `pod.ttl`'s `pod:claimant` comment). Either the claimant **is** a `tpod.member` subject directly — the ordinary case, covering every `p:Person` and every `service:Service` that claims under its own IRI — or it is the `service:providedBy` organization **of** a member subject, which is how a `service:ServiceProvider` member's content gets attributed to the organization behind it. Both of the example tree's organization claimants take the second route: `Boston Hub Society.databook.md`'s graph-92 is claimed by `:BHS` while the member subject is `:BHS_Service`, and `Citibank(banking-payments).databook.md`'s graph-76 is claimed by `:Citibank` while the member subject is `:Citibank_Service`. The `providedBy` link lives in the graph Turtle, not the frontmatter, so the script below reads it out of the pod's own embedded graph bodies. Run:

```python
import re, yaml, glob

def frontmatter(path):
    text = open(path, encoding='utf-8').read()
    m = re.match(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---', text, re.DOTALL)
    return yaml.safe_load(m.group(1)) if m else None

violations = 0
for f in glob.glob('example/Pods/**/*.databook.md', recursive=True):
    if 'under-development' in f.split('/'):
        continue
    fm = frontmatter(f)
    if not fm:
        continue
    tpod = fm.get('tpod', {}) or {}
    tools = tpod.get('tool') or []
    tools = tools if isinstance(tools, list) else [tools]
    if not tools:
        continue
    mt = tpod.get('member') or []
    mt = mt if isinstance(mt, list) else [mt]
    member_subs = {t.get('subject') for t in mt}
    # A pod:claimant may also be the service:providedBy organization of a
    # member subject — how a service:ServiceProvider member's content is
    # attributed to the organization behind it. Collect those too, reading the
    # providedBy links out of this pod's own embedded graph bodies.
    body = open(f, encoding='utf-8').read()
    provided = set()
    for svc, org in re.findall(
            r'(:\w+)\s+rdf:type[^.;]*?;[^.]*?service:providedBy\s+(:\w+)', body, re.DOTALL):
        if svc in member_subs:
            provided.add(org)
    allowed = member_subs | provided
    # The cap is per tool: each tool's own graphs must be claimed by distinct
    # members, but two different tools may each be claimed by the same member.
    for i, tool in enumerate(tools):
        graphs = tool.get('graph') or []
        graphs = graphs if isinstance(graphs, list) else [graphs]
        claimants = [g.get('claimant') for g in graphs]
        non_member = [c for c in claimants if c not in allowed]
        if non_member:
            violations += 1
            print(f"VIOLATION {f}: tool {i} graph claimant(s) {non_member} resolve to none of this pod's own members {sorted(s for s in allowed if s)}")
        seen, dup = set(), set()
        for c in claimants:
            (dup.add(c) if c in seen else seen.add(c))
        if dup:
            violations += 1
            print(f'VIOLATION {f}: tool {i} claimant(s) {sorted(dup)} repeat — each of a tool\'s graphs must be claimed by a distinct member')
print('All pods satisfy the tool-graph claimant invariants (member-only, distinct per tool).' if violations == 0 else f'{violations} violation(s) found.')
```

If a violation is found: for a tool graph claimed by a non-member, either add that claimant as a new `member` entry first, or — if the claimant is the organization behind a `service:ServiceProvider` that is already a member — add the missing `service:providedBy` triple to that service's own member graph, or reconsider whether the claim really belongs in this pod's tool at all. For a repeated claimant within one tool, merge the two graphs' content into one — a single member can only make one claim about a given tool's topic, not two.

**YAML-9 — pod tag well-formedness**: A pod's two tag fields — `tpod.userTag` and `tpod.serviceTag` (`pod:userTag`/`pod:serviceTag`, `pod.ttl`'s Pod Tags section) — are each optional and each 0..N, but they are different shapes and SHACL reaches different distances into each, so what is left for this check differs by kind. **`tpod.userTag`** is a plain string, and `shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`'s `:InstancePodShape` constrains it only to a non-empty one (`sh:minLength 1`), leaving all three of the original failure modes here. *Whitespace*: `" Ginger"` and `"Ginger"` are distinct strings that `sh:minLength` accepts equally, and a padded tag silently fails to match its own unpadded twin in a tag search. *Type confusion*: a YAML value that isn't a string at all — a bare `2027` parsing as an integer, or a nested mapping left behind by a hand edit — reaches synthesis as a non-string, and `helpers/databook_graphs.py`'s `emit_lit()` stringifies whatever it is rather than rejecting it. *Duplication*: RDF is a set, so a tag repeated twice under this property collapses to a single triple *before* validation ever runs, making the duplicate permanently invisible to SHACL no matter what constraint is written. **`tpod.serviceTag`** is a nested mapping per value, and its three sub-keys become `pod:tagNamespace`/`pod:tagKey`/`pod:tagValue` on a `pod:ServiceTag` node that `:ServiceTagShape` constrains directly — spelling, cardinality and surrounding whitespace included. This check therefore does **not** repeat those regexes; duplicating them here would only let the two drift. What it covers for this kind is what no SHACL constraint can reach: a **sub-value that is not a string**, which `emit_lit()` stringifies into something that may well pass (a YAML float `1.2` becomes `"1.2"` and satisfies the reverse-DNS pattern outright); an **entry that is not a mapping at all**, typically a leftover flat `"AppleContacts/Christmas_List"` string from the retired opaque-string form, which SHACL can only report as three anonymous `sh:minCount` failures with no hint that the YAML shape is the problem; an **unrecognized extra sub-key**, which the emitter drops silently so RDF never learns it existed; the field being **present but empty**, indistinguishable in RDF from the field being absent; and **duplication**, which changes character here rather than disappearing — two identical entries synthesize two *distinct* blank nodes, so unlike a repeated literal the duplicate really is present after synthesis, but comparing sibling nodes needs a SPARQL query rather than any core SHACL constraint, and this repo uses `sh:sparql` nowhere. Deduplication is on the whole `(namespace, key, value)` triple, never on `(namespace, key)` alone: a contact sitting in three Apple Contacts Groups is legitimately three tags sharing one namespace and one key. Duplication *across* kinds is deliberately not flagged — the two properties are separate. This check reads YAML directly, before synthesis, which is the only point at which any of it is still observable. Run:

print('Every pod tag is well-formed.' if violations == 0 else f'{violations} violation(s) found.')
```

If a violation is found: quote a value that parsed as a number, trim the padding, drop the duplicate, restore a flat-string `serviceTag` entry to the three-sub-key mapping form, or delete a tag field that carries nothing rather than leaving it present and empty. Never "fix" a duplicate by moving one copy to a different tag kind just to silence the check — if the same label genuinely belongs to two kinds that is legal and this check already permits it, but a duplicate *within* one kind is always an editing slip. Nor should a repeated `(namespace, key)` pair be "fixed" by inventing a second key: a contact in two Apple Contacts Groups is two entries differing only in `value`, which is exactly right.

## FS — filesystem and documentation checks

These read the **filesystem** — folder structure, filenames, which image files exist — and the documentation prose that refers to them. All of it is development scaffolding (see [storage.md](storage.md)): these keep this repo internally consistent and say nothing about how a running Tellipod stores anything.


**FS-1 — Validation documentation completeness**: The `## Validation` section of `example.md` must document a single validator, `helpers/validate.py`, run from the repo root as `python3 helpers/validate.py`. There are no "tiers" — that two-tier split (a global merged-data run plus a per-graph run) was retired because merging every pod into one default graph unions facts that the self-containment convention deliberately keeps per-graph, manufacturing violations no real query would see (the same reasoning as the [Named graph scoping of `BFO_0000115`](CLAUDE.md#key-architectural-patterns) note). The script walks every pod-databook under `example/Pods/` (skipping `under-development/`), validating **each pod in isolation from every other pod** — no two pods' data ever reach the same `shacl validate` call — and gives each pod two passes:

1. **Pod pass** — data is the pod's whole content at once: every one of its embedded graphs' Turtle (via `databook_graphs.iter_graph_blocks()`) plus the `pod:` triples synthesized from that pod's own `tpod.*` frontmatter (via `databook_graphs.process_pod_databook()`, shared with `helpers/yaml-to-rdf.py`). Shapes are the four general shapes files merged into one graph with `owl:imports` stripped: `shacl/pod-shacl.ttl`, `shacl/persona-shacl.ttl`, `shacl/organization-shacl.ttl`, `shacl/service-shacl.ttl`. The graph Turtle must be in this data, not just the frontmatter triples — `:InstancePodShape` constrains `creator`/`owner` with `sh:class p:Person` and `:CGraphShape` constrains `claimant` with `sh:or ( [sh:class p:Person] [sh:class o:Organization] [sh:class service:Service] )`, and those individuals are typed only in the graph Turtle. This pass is the only thing that validates `pod-shacl` against real instance data.
2. **Template pass** — each graph carrying a `shape:` value, checked on its own against the shape that value names. Since `pod:shape`'s range is `sh:NodeShape` (`pod.ttl`), the value already names the shape directly, with no label-to-shape resolution; the script's `SHAPE_TO_FILE` table only maps that shape's local name to which physical `*-shacl.ttl` file defines it, since `pshapes:` shapes are split across `shacl/persona-shacl.ttl` and `shacl/contactinfo-shacl.ttl`. A graph with no `template:` value is skipped. Each resolved shape is scoped so it can't fire outside the one graph being checked: every other shape co-located in the same physical file is deactivated, and — only for `ContactInfoShape` (`sh:targetClass persona:Person`, the one class broad enough to risk an incidental same-type individual, e.g. a bare `:Self` reasserted by the self-containment convention) — the shape is re-targeted (`sh:targetNode`) at only the *substantive* `persona:Person` individual(s) in that graph.

The two passes use **different base merges**, both built once per run: `pod-category-templates.ttl` is in the template pass's base but deliberately excluded from the pod pass's, so `pod-shacl`'s `:PodShape` can't fire on the 102 `ctpl:*TemplatePod` individuals — generic class-level content bound to no real person. The script exits non-zero on any violation or unresolved shape, so it doubles as a CI-style gate.

`example.md` must also document the **merged whole-tree dump** (`helpers/extract-all.py` + `helpers/yaml-to-rdf.py` + `riot`) separately from validation, with the warning that the general shapes must never be run against it. That dump exists for the questions that genuinely need the union — TTL-1's cross-pod reachability, and loading the example into a triplestore — not for SHACL. If the algorithm changes, update `example.md`'s Validation section and `helpers/validate.py` to match.

**FS-2 — PNG file location**: The diagram PNG for every embedded graph (each `tpod.member`/`tpod.tool[].graph` entry across every pod-databook under `example/Pods/`) must be stored directly in `example/graphs/images/` (flat, no subfolders — not `images/example/`) — this location is unchanged by the graph/pod merge; only the graphs' own `.databook.md` files were removed, not this images directory. Files in `under-development/` are excluded. There is no exemption: **every** embedded graph gets a PNG, the `:Self`-stub `member` graph YAML-6 requires on a purely organizational scaffold pod (`graph-38` on `Pods`, `graph-52` on `Work`, `graph-61` on `Vehicles` and the rest) included. Such a graph is not drawn as a circle in any of the 12 diagrams — that is PNG-1g's visual simplification — but being undrawn has no bearing on whether it is diagrammed individually or documented.

**FS-3 — PNG filename convention**: Every diagram PNG in `example/graphs/images/` must use the same base filename as the graph's own `tpod.member[]`/`tpod.tool[].graph[].id` local-name (the string after the final `/`), with `.png` appended. For example, id local-name `graph-14` → `graph-14.png`. If the PNG does not yet exist, the `example.md` Diagram pod must be marked `*(todo)*` rather than left blank. This applies uniformly — a scaffold pod's stub `member` graph gets a row and a Diagram pod like any other graph.

**FS-4 — No broken image links in `README.md`/`example.md`/`app-behavior.md`**: Every PNG path referenced in `README.md`, `example.md`, or `app-behavior.md` (both `<img src="...">` tags and `[view](...)` table links) must resolve to an actual file on disk. Run:

```bash
python3 -c "
import re, os
content = open('README.md').read() + open('example.md').read() + open('app-behavior.md').read()
pngs = [m.group(1) for m in re.finditer(r'src=[\"\\'](.*?\.png)[\"\\']', content)]
pngs += [m.group(1) for m in re.finditer(r'\]\((example/[^\s\"\']+\.png)\)', content)]
missing = [p for p in sorted(set(pngs)) if not os.path.exists(p)]
[print('MISSING:', p) for p in missing] or print('All PNG refs OK')
"
```

**FS-5 — Physical folder structure IS the tree of pods in `example/Pods/`**: This check applies only to `example/Pods/` — the user's own instance tree — since there is no separate canonical-instance file tree to mirror. There is no `tpod.child`/`tpod.pod` YAML list to cross-check the tree against either, so this check has no independently-asserted list to "mirror" at all; it collapses to a pure filesystem sanity check with no YAML frontmatter parsing at all. **This whole check is a scaffolding check.** Tellipod persists nothing in the user's filesystem (see [storage.md](storage.md)), so at runtime there are no folders, no marker, and no tree to walk; every rule below governs `example/Pods/`, the tree this repo carries on disk so that real pod content can be validated and diagrammed before there is an app to hold it (see [Development Scaffolding](pod-databook.md#development-scaffolding) in pod-databook.md). Within that tree, a folder is a **pod** iff it directly contains a `_pod-attachments` folder — that folder is simultaneously the pod's attachments and its tree-node marker. A second marker, the `*.databook.md` file carrying the pod's structured content, is present in every pod folder too, and this check requires the two to agree in both directions — a pod with no `_pod-attachments` is an error, and a `_pod-attachments` whose parent is not a pod folder is an error — which is what keeps the scaffolding from drifting away from the tree it represents. Like everything else here, the databook rules below ("marker dir", `TOO MANY PODS`) are meaningless once the app ships. A folder can never legally hold more than one pod-databook: a `pod:Pod` is self-contained, and letting two pods share a folder would risk a single file in that folder becoming ambiguously part of both — this check flags any such folder as an error. Within this tree the same conclusion also follows structurally, the marker being a folder of one fixed name of which a directory can hold only one. A plain filesystem folder with no `_pod-attachments` of its own is not a pod at all — that word stays reserved for a folder that does have one. Pod naming is not standardized — a pod's own folder name may be the category's display label, a role-based label, or anything else — but a pod-databook's own filename is always the folder's exact verbatim name (see the [Filename Convention](pod-databook.md#filename-convention)), so this check's per-folder marker test and its filename root are one and the same string. Two kinds of folder are neither pods nor errors. The reserved `_pod-attachments` folder holds the pod's attachments (app-behavior.md's [Scaffolding: This Repo's Filesystem Tree](app-behavior.md#scaffolding-this-repos-filesystem-tree)): it is never a marker dir and never a pass-through, must sit directly inside a marker dir, and must hold plain files only — no `*.databook.md` and no subfolder of its own. Every pod has one, empty or not — that being what makes it a pod — so a folder carrying a pod-databook but no `_pod-attachments` is a scaffolding/marker disagreement rather than merely a missing folder; since git cannot track an empty directory, a pod with no attachments carries a `.gitkeep` in it. Hidden files — any whose name begins with a dot — are neither attachments nor private content anywhere in the tree, so they never make an otherwise empty folder count as occupied. A subfolder with no pod anywhere beneath it but files in it is the member's own private content, which they may nest however they like; only a folder with no files anywhere beneath it at all is the empty/placeholder case this check was written to catch. A bare, marker-less pass-through directory between two marker dirs is legal, a folder with no `_pod-attachments` of its own being simply a regular filesystem folder, not a pod — **even if it contains nested pods of its own**: such a folder is legal anywhere in the tree, including between two marker dirs, as long as it isn't otherwise empty (i.e. something beneath it eventually has a pod-databook). Run:

```python
import os

ATTACH = '_pod-attachments'   # the one reserved subfolder name

def check_tree(root):
    marker_dirs = set()
    pod_counts = {}
    for dirpath, _, filenames in os.walk(root):

            marker_dirs.add(rel)
            pod_counts[rel] = pods

        if reldir == '.':

If a `TOO MANY PODS` issue is found, move the extra file(s) out to their own new folder — a folder may hold only one pod-databook, so a second pod belongs in its own new folder, not alongside the first. An empty/placeholder folder is not necessarily an error — flag it to the user rather than deleting it, since it may be a deliberate placeholder for content not yet added. Pod-databook files routinely carry substantial body content (one `### Graph NN` section per embedded graph) — this is expected and not itself a violation of this check, which only validates folder nesting, not file size or content.

**FS-6 — every image on disk is referenced by the documentation**: FS-4 verifies the forward direction — that every image a document references actually exists. This is the inverse: that every PNG under `images/` and `example/images/` is referenced by at least one Markdown file. An unreferenced image is normally a misplaced export or a leftover from a renamed diagram, invisible to every other check precisely because nothing points at it; without this check such a file can sit in the tree indefinitely and be committed by accident. Note this deliberately covers only the two diagram directories, not `example/graphs/images/`, whose per-graph PNGs are generated by `helpers/draw.py` and linked from example.md's graph tables rather than embedded. Run:

```python
import re, glob, os

DIRS = ['images/**/*.png', 'example/images/*.png']
docs = [f for f in glob.glob('**/*.md', recursive=True)
        if 'under-development' not in f.split('/')]

referenced = set()
for f in docs:
    text = open(f, encoding='utf-8').read()
    referenced |= set(re.findall(r'(?:example/)?images/[\w./-]+\.png', text))

on_disk = set()
for pattern in DIRS:
    on_disk |= set(glob.glob(pattern, recursive=True))

orphans = sorted(on_disk - referenced)
for o in orphans:
    print(f'VIOLATION {o}: present on disk but referenced by no Markdown file')
print('Every image on disk is referenced by the documentation.' if not orphans
      else f'{len(orphans)} unreferenced image(s) found.')
```

If a violation is found, decide which way the discrepancy should be resolved: either the image is wanted, and whichever document should embed it is missing its reference (add it, and see FS-4 for the forward direction), or it is a stray — a save that went to the wrong folder, or the old name of a renamed diagram — and should be deleted. Do not simply add a reference to make the check pass; an image nothing needed is a file that should not be in the tree.
