  Cell DataBook for folder "Chestnut Hill Village Association" (cell:category: cat:Groups). It is a
  multi-member cell with three members about :Self, :Marcy, and :Henry — three of the homeowners on the
  three streets that make up Chestnut Hill Village — plus one tool graph about :CHVA itself, the
  association's own organizational profile. Unlike the Boston Hub Society, the association runs no PDN
  node of its own, so it joins the cell through no service:ServiceProvider of its own and Alice
  self-enters its profile: every one of this cell's graphs is claimed by one of its three human members.

### Graph 09

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice Walker's Chestnut Hill Village Association profile — the identity data she shares with her neighbors in the association. It carries the name she goes by there, the email address the association's mailing list reaches her at, and her association social network, whose members are her neighbors Marcy and Henry. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.

### Graph 101

#### Overview

This graph captures the Chestnut Hill Village Association's own organizational profile — the association as an `o:Organization` in its own right, with the number of households it covers and its public website — as the cell's tool graph. Where the Boston Hub Society claims its own profile (graph 92) from its own PDN node, the association has none, so Alice self-enters this one: she is the claimant, and `:CHVA` is never a `cell:member` subject at all. The association's day-to-day working material — its recommended contractors (plumbers, electricians, lawn care and the like), the dates of its annual in-person meeting and its annual spring cleanup event, the name of the current president, and its annual dues — is free text rather than modeled data, and lives in this cell's folder note — `Chestnut Hill Village Association.md`, shown in the app's Note area rather than its Attachments area — instead of here.
