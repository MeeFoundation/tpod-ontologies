  Pod DataBook for folder "Care & Feeding" (pod:category: podcat:PetsCareAndFeeding). It is a two-member pod, shared by Alice with Paula, with two members (about :Self and :Paula_Walker) and one graph about :Ginger, Alice's cat (the pod's subject) — the day-to-day instructions for looking after Ginger, alongside her Medical pod's sibling record of her medical care.

## Graphs

<a id="graph-58"></a>
### Graph 58

#### Overview

This graph is one of the pod's two `member` entries, satisfying the two-member baseline alongside graph 59 (Paula's own claim, below). Alice is both the claimant and the subject — her own bare given-name claim, mirroring graph 59's identical pattern for Paula.

### Graph 59

#### Overview

This pod was created by Alice and later shared with Paula, making the pod a two-member pod. This graph is Paula's own bare identity claim (just her given name) — the pod's second `member` entry, satisfying the two-member baseline alongside graph 58 (Alice's own claim, above). Paula is both the claimant and the subject.

### Graph 60

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's day-to-day care and feeding instructions for her cat Ginger — what to feed her and when, and where she sleeps — so that Paula (or anyone else looking after Ginger) knows how to care for her. Alice is the claimant; Ginger is the pod's `subject` but, since she has no `p:Person` individual of her own, her graph is held by the pod's form tool rather than being one of the required `member` entries (graphs 58 and 59, above, fill those slots instead). No formal template governs this content (unlike her sibling Medical pod's `pets:PetMedicationRecord`, or her own basic identifying claim in graph 37, now governed by `pets:Pet`) — no `pod:TemplatePod` points its `pod:category` at `podcat:PetsCareAndFeeding` — so it is asserted directly as a plain comment.
