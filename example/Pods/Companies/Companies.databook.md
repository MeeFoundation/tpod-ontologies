description: >
  Pod DataBook for folder "Companies" (pod:category: cat:Companies). It is a
  one-member pod with one member entry about :Self — a minimal stub,
  since "Companies" is a purely organizational category node with no
  content or relationship of its own beyond Alice's required membership.
  Also carries an empty tool graph, since cat:Companies's own TemplatePod
  declares a form tool — the real content
  lives in this category's own leaf pods (Google, ATT) instead.

## Graphs

### Graph 40

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is — here, Alice herself. The "Companies" pod is a purely organizational category node (`pod:category: cat:Companies`) with no relationship or subject of its own beyond Alice's required membership. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, satisfying the `ContactInfoShape` `ctpl:CompaniesTemplatePod` sets as `pod:memberShape` — no longer deliberately empty.

### Graph 85

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's required tool graph — required since `cat:Companies`'s own `TemplatePod` declares a form tool, even though "Companies" is a purely organizational scaffold pod with no tool content of its own (the real content lives in this category's own leaf pods, Google and ATT, instead). Deliberately empty — no triples at all. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.
