  Pod DataBook for folder "Google" (pod:category: podcat:Companies). It is a one-member pod with one
  member entry about :Self and one graph about :Alice_Google_Account (the pod's subject), typed
  serviceaccounts:ServiceAccount and cco:ent00000033 (Online Service Account), carrying the service name,
  account username, and password for Alice's Google account.

## Graphs

### Graph 16

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is — here, Alice's Google account itself. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, plus a minimal organization name and email, so `:Self` satisfies the `ContactInfoShape` every templated pod's `member` content is now expected to conform to (`pod:memberShape`) — no longer deliberately empty now that this requirement applies.

### Graph 73

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's basic claim about her Google account itself — just enough to back the pod's `subject: ":Alice_Google_Account"` with a real graph (see YAML-4) — and, validated by `serviceaccounts:ServiceAccount`'s SHACL shape (`other/shacl/service-accounts-shacl.ttl`'s `:ServiceAccountShape`), identifies the service (Google), her account username (her Gmail address — the same Email designator this pod's original single graph used to carry on `:Self` directly, moved here since it's really a fact about the account, not about Alice as a person), and her account password. `:Self` is also, separately, still designated by that same Email address directly (the `:Self`-level fact this pod's `member` graph doesn't itself carry) — a person's Gmail address is both her own contact email and her Google account's username, so it's asserted once here on each individual it actually describes. `:Self` carries `cco:ent00000045` (has/holds user account) to `:Alice_Google_Account`, closing the loop from the Person side.
