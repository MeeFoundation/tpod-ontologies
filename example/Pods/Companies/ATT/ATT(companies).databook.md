  Pod DataBook for folder "ATT" (pod:category: cat:Companies). It is a one-member pod with one
  member entry about :Self and one graph about :Alice_ATT_Account (the pod's subject), typed
  serviceaccounts:ServiceAccount and cco:ent00000033 (Online Service Account), carrying the service name,
  account username, and password for Alice's AT&T account.

### Graph 11

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is — here, Alice's AT&T account itself. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, plus a minimal organization name and email, so `:Self` satisfies the `ContactInfoShape` every templated pod's `member` content is now expected to conform to (`pod:memberShape`) — no longer deliberately empty now that this requirement applies.

### Graph 74

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's basic claim about her AT&T account itself — just enough to back the pod's `subject: ":Alice_ATT_Account"` with a real graph (see YAML-4) — and, validated by `serviceaccounts:ServiceAccount`'s SHACL shape (`other/shacl/service-accounts-shacl.ttl`'s `:ServiceAccountShape`), identifies the service (AT&T), her account username (her mobile phone number, in E.164 format — the same Phone designator this pod's original single graph used to carry on `:Self` directly, moved here since it's really a fact about the account, not about Alice as a person — AT&T accounts are logged into by phone number rather than a separate handle), her account's service URI, and her account password. `:Self` is also, separately, still designated by that same phone number directly (the `:Self`-level fact this pod's `member` graph doesn't itself carry). `:Self` carries `cco:ent00000045` (has/holds user account) to `:Alice_ATT_Account`, closing the loop from the Person side.
