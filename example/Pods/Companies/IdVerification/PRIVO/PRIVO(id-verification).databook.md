  Pod DataBook for folder "PRIVO" (pod:category: podcat:IdVerification), nested under
  "IdVerification". The issuing half of the example tree's Browser Extension flow: Alice visited
  privo.com, which issued her an age-verification credential, and because no pod yet had a member
  whose service:siteDomain was privo.com, her app created this one. A two-member pod: Alice
  (graph-102) and :PRIVO_Site (graph-103). PRIVO supports the Pod Interface natively, so its
  member is not one Alice's app mints on its behalf: :PRIVO_Site is typed service:ServiceProvider
  as well as service:WebsiteService, provided by the organization :PRIVO (PRIVO Inc.), which claims
  the member entry, as every service:ServiceProvider's organization does. The credential itself is
  not in any graph: it is the pod's attachment privo-age-credential.json, kept exactly as PRIVO
  Inc. issued and signed it. The pod:Browser tool comes from the category's template and holds no
  graph of its own.

### Graph 102

#### Overview

This graph is one of the pod's two required `member` entries — Alice's own bare given-name claim (see YAML-6: `:Self` must be a member of every pod in the user's own tree), carrying the given name `ContactInfoShape` requires as this template's `pod:memberShape`. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.

### Graph 103

#### Overview

This graph is the other of the pod's two required `member` entries — PRIVO, the site that issued the credential, as `:PRIVO_Site`. It is typed two ways at once. As a `service:WebsiteService` it carries `service:siteDomain "privo.com"`, the key both credential flows match on: it is how the issuing flow found no existing pod for the site, and how the presenting flow later finds this one when it searches for a credential from a trusted issuer. As a `service:ServiceProvider` it carries `service:providedBy :PRIVO`, since PRIVO supports the Pod Interface natively, joining the pod and writing to it itself rather than having Alice's app mint a member on its behalf. Like every `service:ServiceProvider`, it is this entry's subject but not its claimant: the claims are PRIVO Inc.'s, the organization that also signed the credential this pod holds — the same pattern as `:BHS_Service` (graph 01) and `:Citibank_Service` (graph 27). No class in `service.ttl` is disjoint from any other, so the two types sit together without conflict.

Like graph 96, this `member` graph declares `pshapes:ContactInfoShape` (required of every member graph by TTL-7) while carrying no `persona:Person` individual at all, so it is vacuously conformant; `shacl/service-shacl.ttl`'s `:WebsiteServiceShape` and `:ServiceProviderShape` are what validate its content.
