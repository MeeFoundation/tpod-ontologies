description: >
  Pod DataBook for folder "IdVerification" (pod:category: podcat:IdVerification), nested under
  "Companies". It is a one-member pod with one member entry about :Self — a minimal stub, since
  "IdVerification" is a purely organizational category node with no content or relationship of
  its own beyond Alice's required membership; its real content lives in its own leaf pod (PRIVO).
  Also carries the pod:Browser tool podcat:IdVerification's own TemplatePod declares, which, being
  a browser rather than a form, holds no graph at all, so there is no empty tool graph to carry.

### Graph 107

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6). The "IdVerification" pod is a purely organizational category node (`pod:category: podcat:IdVerification`) with no relationship or subject of its own beyond Alice's required membership. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, satisfying the `ContactInfoShape` `ctpl:IdVerificationTemplatePod` sets as `pod:memberShape`.
