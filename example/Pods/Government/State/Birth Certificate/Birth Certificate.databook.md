### Graph 24

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6). Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, satisfying the `ContactInfoShape` every templated pod's `member` content is now expected to conform to (`pod:memberShape`) — no longer the birth certificate document content, which now lives in this pod's tool graph instead (graph 78).

### Graph 78

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice Walker's Texas birth certificate identity data — moved here, as this pod's tool content, from the pod's former `member` graph-24. Alice self-enters her legal name (Margery Alice Walker) and maiden name (Margery Alice Arnold) from her physical birth certificate. Validated by the `BirthCertificateShape` per-template SHACL shape (`other/shacl/identity-documents-shacl.ttl`). Alice is the claimant.
