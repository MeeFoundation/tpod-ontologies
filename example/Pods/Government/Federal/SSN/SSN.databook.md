### Graph 23

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6). Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, satisfying the `ContactInfoShape` every templated pod's `member` content is now expected to conform to (`pod:memberShape`) — no longer the SSN itself, which now lives in this pod's tool graph instead (graph 80).

### Graph 80

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice Walker's Social Security Administration record — moved here, as this pod's tool content, from the pod's former `member` graph-23. Alice self-enters her SSN (123-45-6788) from her physical Social Security card. The SSA is not a PDN node, so this data is self-claimed rather than received from the SSA directly. Validated by `shacl/persona-shacl.ttl`'s `:SSNShape` (reused directly as this pod's declared tool's `pod:formShape`, since the SSN designator has no separate document class of its own). Alice is the claimant.
