### Graph 34

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's own bare identity claim (just her given name) — the pod's one required `member` entry, satisfying the single-member baseline. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.

### Graph 25

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's record of Dr. Jane Starostina, who is the primary care physician for Alice's daughter, Sophia Walker, including her medical specialty (Endocrinology), via `persona:specialty` — the `pod:formShape` of the tool `podcat:PrimaryCarePhysician` declares (`:PrimaryCarePhysicianShape`). Alice keeps this information so she and her husband Dave can coordinate Sophia's medical appointments. Alice is the claimant; Jane is the pod's `subject` but, since this pod now has a real member entry (graph 34, above) about Alice herself, Jane's graph is held by the pod's form tool rather than being one of the required `member` entries.
