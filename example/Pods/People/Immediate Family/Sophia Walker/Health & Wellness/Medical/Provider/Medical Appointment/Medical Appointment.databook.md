### Graph 26

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's shared record of the claims needed to arrange a medical appointment on behalf of their daughter, Sophia Walker. Alice maintains this record on her own instance of the app and syncs it to Dave's over the PDN so both parents can coordinate Sophia's care. Because each graph's named graph must be self-contained for p2p sync to work, the claims about Sophia and about her primary care physician, Dr. Jane Starostina, are copied directly into this graph rather than merely linked — Alice already holds Dr. Jane's information in her own instance, so it is Alice's own app that copies it over. Validated by the `MedicalAppointment` per-template SHACL shapes. Alice is the claimant.

### Graph 28

#### Overview

This graph captures Dave's own self-claimed persona and contact info, shared directly from his own instance of the app to Alice's over the PDN — his given name already satisfies the `ContactInfoShape` every templated pod's `member` content is now expected to conform to (`pod:memberShape`); the organization name below is optional extra detail, not what the shape actually requires. This pod's two members are Alice and Dave (its derived subject, `:Sophia_Walker` (from its sole tool's `formTopic`), is a third party the pod is *about*, not one of its members) — this graph and its counterpart (graph 30, Alice's own self-claimed contact info) together represent those two members, alongside graph 26 (Alice's claims about Sophia's medical appointment). Dave is the claimant.

### Graph 30

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice Walker's own self-claimed contact info, kept in this pod so Dave can reach her while coordinating Sophia's medical appointments, plus her given name, which is what actually satisfies the `ContactInfoShape` every templated pod's `member` content is now expected to conform to (`pod:memberShape`) — the organization name below is optional extra detail, not a requirement. This pod's two members are Alice and Dave (its derived subject, `:Sophia_Walker` (from its sole tool's `formTopic`), is a third party the pod is *about*, not one of its members) — this graph and its counterpart (graph 28, Dave's own self-claimed persona) together represent those two members, alongside graph 26 (Alice's claims about Sophia's medical appointment). Alice is the claimant.
