## Graphs

<a id="graph-35"></a>
### Graph 35

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's own bare identity claim (just her given name) — the pod's one required `member` entry. A pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (the user either created the pod themselves or received it via sharing — either way `:Self` participates), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.

### Graph 17

#### Overview

This graph captures Sophia Walker's physical body characteristics — properties that are intrinsic to her as a person and do not belong to any particular institutional or social graph — as recorded by Alice. Height is recorded as a CCO Height quality with a RatioMeasurementICE (52 inches). Eye color is modeled as Sophia bearing a BlueEyeColor quality directly. Hair color is borne by her ScalpHair continuant part. Alice is the claimant; Sophia is the pod's `subject` but, since this pod now has a real member entry (graph 35, above) about Alice herself, Sophia's graph is held by the pod's form tool rather than being one of the required `member` entries.
