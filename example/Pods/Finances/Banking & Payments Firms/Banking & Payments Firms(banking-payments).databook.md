description: >
  Pod DataBook for folder "Banking & Payments Firms" (pod:category: podcat:BankingPayments). It is a
  one-member pod with one member entry about :Self — a minimal stub,
  since "Banking & Payments Firms" is a purely organizational category node with no
  content or relationship of its own beyond Alice's required membership.
  Also carries an empty tool graph, since podcat:BankingPayments's own TemplatePod
  declares a form tool — the real content
  lives in this category's own leaf pod (Citibank) instead.

### Graph 42

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is — here, Alice herself. The "Banking & Payments Firms" pod is a purely organizational category node (`pod:category: podcat:BankingPayments`) with no relationship or subject of its own beyond Alice's required membership. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, satisfying the `ContactInfoShape` `ctpl:BankingPaymentsTemplatePod` sets as `pod:memberShape` — no longer deliberately empty.

### Graph 86

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's required tool graph — required since `podcat:BankingPayments`'s own `TemplatePod` declares a form tool, even though "Banking & Payments Firms" is a purely organizational scaffold pod with no tool content of its own (the real content lives in this category's own leaf pod, Citibank, instead). Deliberately empty — no triples at all. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.
