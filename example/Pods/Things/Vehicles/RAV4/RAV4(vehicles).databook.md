  Pod DataBook for folder "RAV4" (pod:category: cat:Vehicles). A user-defined instance folder for
  Alice's car, nested under the generic Vehicles category — mirroring how "Ginger" reuses its parent
  "Pets" folder's own origin class rather than being Custom. It is a one-member pod with one member
  entry about :Self and one graph about :Alice_RAV4 (the pod's subject), typed vehicles:Vehicle and
  carrying its vehicle type, make, model, model year, VIN, color, body type, fuel type, drive wheel
  configuration, odometer reading, and engine specification.

### Graph 62

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is — here, the RAV4 itself. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, plus a minimal organization name and email, so `:Self` satisfies the `ContactInfoShape` every templated pod's `member` content is now expected to conform to (`pod:memberShape`) — no longer deliberately empty now that this requirement applies.

### Graph 63

#### Overview

This graph captures Alice's basic claim about her car itself — just enough to back the pod's `subject: ":Alice_RAV4"` with a real graph (see YAML-4) — and, validated by `vehicles:Vehicle`'s SHACL shape (`other/shacl/vehicles-shacl.ttl`'s `:VehicleShape`), identifies its vehicle type (`vehicles:Car`, class-value-punned), make and model (both real Wikidata individuals vendored in `project_files/wikidata-vehicle-makes-subset.ttl`/`project_files/wikidata-vehicle-models-subset.ttl`), model year, VIN, color, body type, fuel type, drive wheel configuration, current odometer reading (a `vehicles:OdometerReading` individual reusing CCO's decimal-value/measurement-unit pattern, the same reification style `pets:BodyWeight`/`pets:DosageAmount` already use), and engine specification. `:Self persona:hasVehicle :Alice_RAV4` closes the loop from the Person side.
