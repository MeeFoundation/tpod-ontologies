  Pod DataBook for folder "Vehicles" (pod:category: podcat:Vehicles), nested under "Things". It is a
  one-member pod with one member entry about :Self — a minimal stub, since "Vehicles" is a purely
  organizational category node with no content or relationship of its own beyond Alice's required
  membership. Also carries an empty tool graph, since podcat:Vehicles's own TemplatePod
  declares a form tool — the real content lives in this category's own leaf pod
  (RAV4) instead.

## Graphs

### Graph 61

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is — here, Alice herself. The "Vehicles" pod is a purely organizational category node (`pod:category: podcat:Vehicles`) with no relationship or subject of its own beyond Alice's required membership. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, satisfying the `ContactInfoShape` `ctpl:VehicleProfileTemplatePod` sets as `pod:memberShape` — no longer deliberately empty.

### Graph 89

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's required tool graph — required since `podcat:Vehicles`'s own `TemplatePod` declares a form tool, even though "Vehicles" is a purely organizational scaffold pod with no tool content of its own (the real content lives in this category's own leaf pod, RAV4, instead). Deliberately empty — no triples at all. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.
