description: >
  Pod DataBook for folder "Trips" (pod:category: podcat:Trips), nested under "Travel". It is a
  one-member pod with one member entry about :Self — a minimal stub, since "Trips" is a purely
  organizational category node with no content or relationship of its own beyond Alice's required
  membership. Nested inside it is the "Kyoto Trip 2027" pod for a specific trip. also carries an empty tool graph, since podcat:Trips's own
  TemplatePod declares a form tool — the real content lives in this category's own leaf pod (Kyoto Trip 2027) instead.

### Graph 65

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's one required `member` entry — a pod with a single `member` entry in the user's own category-pod tree always has `:Self` as that member (see YAML-6), regardless of what the pod's `subject` is. The "Trips" pod is a purely organizational category node (`pod:category: podcat:Trips`) with no relationship or subject of its own beyond Alice's required membership. Alice is both the claimant and the subject. It carries her given name, satisfying the `ContactInfoShape` `ctpl:TripsTemplatePod` sets as `pod:memberShape` — no longer deliberately empty.

### Graph 90

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's required tool graph — required since `podcat:Trips`'s own `TemplatePod` declares a form tool, even though "Trips" is a purely organizational scaffold pod with no tool content of its own (the real content lives in this category's own leaf pod, Kyoto Trip 2027, instead). Deliberately empty — no triples at all. Alice is both the claimant and the subject.
