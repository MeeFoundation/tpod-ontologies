description: >
  Pod DataBook for folder "Kyoto Trip 2027" (pod:category: cat:Trips, reusing its parent "Trips"
  pod's own origin), nested under "Travel" > "Trips". A user-defined instance folder for a
  specific trip Alice is planning with her spouse Dave. A three-member pod demonstrating
  service:ChatGPT as a real pod member: Alice's own AI travel agent joins alongside Alice and Dave,
  each with a self-claimed member entry (graph-66, graph-67, graph-68). The trip itself is backed
  by three tool graphs sharing one subject (:Kyoto_Trip_2027), one per member, each with a
  distinct claimant — Alice's own basic claim (graph-69), her agent's own evolving,
  collaboratively-drafted itinerary (graph-70), and Dave's own contribution (graph-91) — reaching
  pod:formGraph's real upper bound (one graph per member, see YAML-8) and mirroring how a
  tool's topic may be claimed from more than one side (see the Medical Appointment pod's two
  "Med. Appt mt." squares in README.md's Representative Pods diagram).

### Graph 66

#### Overview

This graph is one of the pod's three required `member` entries — Alice's own bare given-name claim (see YAML-6: `:Self` must be a member of every pod in the user's own tree, regardless of member count), extended with her social network link to Dave (mirroring the pattern used in graph 12's Alice–Bob connection) — this is what makes `:Dave` reachable per TTL-1, since he is otherwise referenced only via this pod's `member`/`tool`, not via a dedicated Immediate Family pod of his own (out of scope for this worked example).

### Graph 67

#### Overview

This graph is another of the pod's three required `member` entries — Alice's own AI travel agent, invited to collaborate on planning this trip, joins as a real pod member (see README.md's Service Ontology section) rather than staying an invisible tool: it gets its own self-claimed member graph, exactly like a human member's, typed `service:ChatGPT` — a leaf under `service:AgentService` — and carrying `service:actsFor :Self` to record which member it is a delegate for. A `service:Service` is never a `pod:creator` — Alice alone created this pod — but it is a legitimate `pod:claimant` and `pod:member` participant. Unlike a `service:ServiceProvider`, whose claims are attributed to the organization providing it, an AI agent claims under its own IRI: no organization stands behind it in this pod's relationship.

<a id="graph-68"></a>
### Graph 68

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's third required `member` entry — Dave's own self-claimed bare given-name persona, transmitted from Dave's own instance of the app to Alice's over the PDN once she invited him to this pod, the same "self-claimed member" pattern Bob Johnson's own graphs use. This third distinct `member` `subject` (alongside `:Self` and `:Alice_Travel_Agent`) is what makes the pod a three-member pod rather than a two-member pod.

<a id="graph-69"></a>
### Graph 69

#### Overview

This graph is one of the pod's three tool graphs — Alice's own basic claim identifying the trip itself, backing the pod's derived subject `:Kyoto_Trip_2027` with a real graph claimed by her directly (see YAML-4), distinct from her agent's own more substantive contribution ([graph 70](#graph-70)). Both tool graphs share the same subject but a different claimant — mirroring the Medical Appointment pod's two "Med. Appt mt." squares (see README.md's Representative Pods diagram), where one tool's topic is claimed from each side.

<a id="graph-70"></a>
### Graph 70

#### Overview

This graph is one of the pod's three tool graphs — Alice's travel agent's own evolving understanding of the trip, claimed by the agent rather than by Alice, Dave, or a third `p:Person`/`o:Organization`. This is the agent's single evolving graph — revised in place turn by turn as Alice and her agent go back and forth (see app-behavior.md's Agent Collaboration section), rather than a new graph per conversation turn. Typed `itineraries:Itinerary` (no existing CCO/domain class to multi-type alongside — there is no dedicated trip-planning domain ontology yet), validated by the `ItineraryShape` per-template SHACL shape, which requires only a human-readable label or description rather than any structured trip-planning fields.

<a id="graph-91"></a>
### Graph 91

#### Overview

This graph is the pod's third tool graph — Dave's own contribution to the trip, claimed by him directly rather than routed through Alice or her travel agent. With this graph, the pod reaches `pod:formGraph`'s real upper bound: one graph per member, each with a distinct claimant (Self, the agent, and now Dave — see YAML-8), the same subject `:Kyoto_Trip_2027` claimed from all three sides at once.
